Sampling in Cloud Benchmarking: A Critical Review and Methodological Guidelines,"arXiv:2502.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud benchmarks suffer from performance fluctuations caused by resource contention, network latency, hardware heterogeneity, and other factors along with decisions taken in the benchmark design. In particular, the sampling strategy of benchmark designers can significantly influence benchmark results. Despite this well-known fact, no systematic approach has been devised so far to make sampling results comparable and guide benchmark designers in choosing their sampling strategy for use within benchmarks. To identify systematic problems, we critically review sampling in recent cloud computing research. Our analysis identifies concerning trends: (i) a high prevalence of non-probability sampling, (ii) over-reliance on a single benchmark, and (iii) restricted access to samples. To address these issues and increase transparency in sampling, we propose methodological guidelines for researchers and reviewers. We hope that our work contributes to improving the generalizability, reproducibility, and reliability of research results.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15399,"Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Offload Rethinking by Cloud Assistance for Efficient Environmental Sound Recognition on LPWANs,"arXiv:2502.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to $80 \times$ in energy savings and $220 \times$ in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15285,"Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
