Zero loss guarantees and explicit minimizers for generic overparametrized Deep Learning networks,"arXiv:2502.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine sufficient conditions for overparametrized deep learning (DL) networks to guarantee the attainability of zero loss in the context of supervised learning, for the $\mathcal{L}^2$ cost and {\em generic} training data. We present an explicit construction of the zero loss minimizers without invoking gradient descent. On the other hand, we point out that increase of depth can deteriorate the efficiency of cost minimization using a gradient descent algorithm by analyzing the conditions for rank loss of the training Jacobian. Our results clarify key aspects on the dichotomy between zero loss reachability in underparametrized versus overparametrized DL.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14114,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Chasing the Timber Trail: Machine Learning to Reveal Harvest Location Misrepresentation,"arXiv:2502.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to global biodiversity, climate stability, and depresses international prices for legal wood harvesting and responsible forest products trade, affecting livelihoods and communities across the globe. Stable isotope ratio analysis (SIRA) is rapidly becoming an important tool for determining the harvest location of traded, organic, products. The spatial pattern in stable isotope ratio values depends on factors such as atmospheric and environmental conditions and can thus be used for geographical identification. We present here the results of a deployed machine learning pipeline where we leverage both isotope values and atmospheric variables to determine timber harvest location. Additionally, the pipeline incorporates uncertainty estimation to facilitate the interpretation of harvest location determination for analysts. We present our experiments on a collection of oak (Quercus spp.) tree samples from its global range. Our pipeline outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models determining geographic harvest origin of commercially traded wood products, and has been used by European enforcement agencies to identify illicit Russian and Belarusian timber entering the EU market. We also identify opportunities for further advancement of our framework and how it can be generalized to help identify the origin of falsely labeled organic products throughout the supply chain.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14115,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Gradients can train reward models: An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model,"arXiv:2502.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14131,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Blockchain-based Framework for Scalable and Incentivized Federated Learning,"arXiv:2502.14170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, preserving privacy while harnessing distributed datasets. However, traditional FL systems often rely on centralized aggregating mechanisms, introducing trust issues, single points of failure, and limited mechanisms for incentivizing meaningful client contributions. These challenges are exacerbated as FL scales to train resource-intensive models, such as large language models (LLMs), requiring scalable, decentralized solutions. This paper presents a blockchain-based FL framework that addresses these limitations by integrating smart contracts and a novel hybrid incentive mechanism. The framework automates critical FL tasks, including client registration, update validation, reward distribution, and maintaining a transparent global state. The hybrid incentive mechanism combines on-chain alignment-based rewards, off-chain fairness checks, and consistency multipliers to ensure fairness, transparency, and sustained engagement. We evaluate the framework through gas cost analysis, demonstrating its feasibility for different scales of federated learning scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14170,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
InstaSHAP: Interpretable Additive Models Explain Shapley Values Instantly,"arXiv:2502.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the Shapley value and SHAP explanations have emerged as one of the most dominant paradigms for providing post-hoc explanations of black-box models. Despite their well-founded theoretical properties, many recent works have focused on the limitations in both their computational efficiency and their representation power. The underlying connection with additive models, however, is left critically under-emphasized in the current literature. In this work, we find that a variational perspective linking GAM models and SHAP explanations is able to provide deep insights into nearly all recent developments. In light of this connection, we borrow in the other direction to develop a new method to train interpretable GAM models which are automatically purified to compute the Shapley value in a single forward pass. Finally, we provide theoretical results showing the limited representation power of GAM models is the same Achilles' heel existing in SHAP and discuss the implications for SHAP's modern usage in CV and NLP.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14177,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Asymmetric Co-Training for Source-Free Few-Shot Domain Adaptation,"arXiv:2502.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) has gained significant attention as an alternative to traditional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which relies on the constant availability of labeled source data. However, SFUDA approaches come with inherent limitations that are frequently overlooked. These challenges include performance degradation when the unlabeled target data fails to meet critical assumptions, such as having a closed-set label distribution identical to that of the source domain, or when sufficient unlabeled target data is unavailable-a common situation in real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose an asymmetric co-training (ACT) method specifically designed for the SFFSDA scenario. SFFSDA presents a more practical alternative to SFUDA, as gathering a few labeled target instances is more feasible than acquiring large volumes of unlabeled target data in many real-world contexts. Our ACT method begins by employing a weak-strong augmentation to enhance data diversity. Then we use a two-step optimization process to train the target model. In the first step, we optimize the label smoothing cross-entropy loss, the entropy of the class-conditional distribution, and the reverse-entropy loss to bolster the model's discriminative ability while mitigating overfitting. The second step focuses on reducing redundancy in the output space by minimizing classifier determinacy disparity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ACT approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art SFUDA methods and transfer learning techniques. Our findings suggest that adapting a source pre-trained model using only a small amount of labeled target data offers a practical and dependable solution.

Predicting Fetal Birthweight from High Dimensional Data using Advanced Machine Learning,"arXiv:2502.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birth weight serves as a fundamental indicator of neonatal health, closely linked to both early medical interventions and long-term developmental risks. Traditional predictive models, often constrained by limited feature selection and incomplete datasets, struggle to achieve overlooking complex maternal and fetal interactions in diverse clinical settings. This research explores machine learning to address these limitations, utilizing a structured methodology that integrates advanced imputation strategies, supervised feature selection techniques, and predictive modeling. Given the constraints of the dataset, the research strengthens the role of data preprocessing in improving the model performance. Among the various methodologies explored, tree-based feature selection methods demonstrated superior capability in identifying the most relevant predictors, while ensemble-based regression models proved highly effective in capturing non-linear relationships and complex maternal-fetal interactions within the data. Beyond model performance, the study highlights the clinical significance of key physiological determinants, offering insights into maternal and fetal health factors that influence birth weight, offering insights that extend over statistical modeling. By bridging computational intelligence with perinatal research, this work underscores the transformative role of machine learning in enhancing predictive accuracy, refining risk assessment and informing data-driven decision-making in maternal and neonatal care.

Graph Anomaly Detection via Adaptive Test-time Representation Learning across Out-of-Distribution Domains,"arXiv:2502.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) has demonstrated great effectiveness in identifying unusual patterns within graph-structured data. However, while labeled anomalies are often scarce in emerging applications, existing supervised GAD approaches are either ineffective or not applicable when moved across graph domains due to distribution shifts and heterogeneous feature spaces. To address these challenges, we present AdaGraph-T3, a novel test-time training framework for cross-domain GAD. AdaGraph-T3 combines supervised and self-supervised learning during training while adapting to a new domain during test time using only self-supervised learning by leveraging a homophily-based affinity score that captures domain-invariant properties of anomalies. Our framework introduces four key innovations to cross-domain GAD: an effective self-supervision scheme, an attention-based mechanism that dynamically learns edge importance weights during message passing, domain-specific encoders for handling heterogeneous features, and class-aware regularization to address imbalance. Experiments across multiple cross-domain settings demonstrate that AdaGraph-T3 significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving average improvements of over 6.6% in AUROC and 7.9% in AUPRC compared to the best competing model.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14293,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Achieving adaptivity and optimality for multi-armed bandits using Exponential-Kullback Leiblier Maillard Sampling,"arXiv:2502.14379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) with reward distributions belonging to a One-Parameter Exponential Distribution (OPED) family. In the literature, several criteria have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such algorithms, including Asymptotic Optimality (A.O.), Minimax Optimality (M.O.), Sub-UCB, and variance-adaptive worst-case regret bound. Thompson Sampling (TS)-based and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based algorithms have been employed to achieve some of these criteria. However, none of these algorithms simultaneously satisfy all the aforementioned criteria.
  In this paper, we design an algorithm, Exponential Kullback-Leibler Maillard Sampling (abbrev. \expklms), that can achieve multiple optimality criteria simultaneously, including A.O., M.O. with a logarithmic factor, Sub-UCB, and variance-adaptive worst-case regret bound.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14379,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

An Entropic Metric for Measuring Calibration of Machine Learning Models,"arXiv:2502.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the confidence with which a machine learning model classifies an input datum is an important, and perhaps under-investigated, concept. In this paper, we propose a new calibration metric, the Entropic Calibration Difference (ECD). Based on existing research in the field of state estimation, specifically target tracking (TT), we show how ECD may be applied to binary classification machine learning models. We describe the relative importance of under- and over-confidence and how they are not conflated in the TT literature. Indeed, our metric distinguishes under- from over-confidence. We consider this important given that algorithms that are under-confident are likely to be 'safer' than algorithms that are over-confident, albeit at the expense of also being over-cautious and so statistically inefficient. We demonstrate how this new metric performs on real and simulated data and compare with other metrics for machine learning model probability calibration, including the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and its signed counterpart, the Expected Signed Calibration Error (ESCE).",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14545,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
General Uncertainty Estimation with Delta Variances,"arXiv:2502.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision makers may suffer from uncertainty induced by limited data. This may be mitigated by accounting for epistemic uncertainty, which is however challenging to estimate efficiently for large neural networks. To this extent we investigate Delta Variances, a family of algorithms for epistemic uncertainty quantification, that is computationally efficient and convenient to implement. It can be applied to neural networks and more general functions composed of neural networks. As an example we consider a weather simulator with a neural-network-based step function inside -- here Delta Variances empirically obtain competitive results at the cost of a single gradient computation. The approach is convenient as it requires no changes to the neural network architecture or training procedure. We discuss multiple ways to derive Delta Variances theoretically noting that special cases recover popular techniques and present a unified perspective on multiple related methods. Finally we observe that this general perspective gives rise to a natural extension and empirically show its benefit.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14698,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Sculpting [CLS] Features for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning,"arXiv:2502.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Although pre-trained models have demonstrated strong performance in class-incremental learning, they remain susceptible to catastrophic forgetting when learning new concepts. Excessive plasticity in the models breaks generalizability and causes forgetting, while strong stability results in insufficient adaptation to new classes. This necessitates effective adaptation with minimal modifications to preserve the general knowledge of pre-trained models. To address this challenge, we first introduce a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning module 'Learn and Calibrate', or LuCA, designed to acquire knowledge through an adapter-calibrator couple, enabling effective adaptation with well-refined feature representations. Second, for each learning session, we deploy a sparse LuCA module on top of the last token just before the classifier, which we refer to as 'Token-level Sparse Calibration and Adaptation', or TOSCA. This strategic design improves the orthogonality between the modules and significantly reduces both training and inference complexity. By leaving the generalization capabilities of the pre-trained models intact and adapting exclusively via the last token, our approach achieves a harmonious balance between stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate TOSCA's state-of-the-art performance while introducing ~8 times fewer parameters compared to prior methods.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14762,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Probabilistic Robustness in Deep Learning: A Concise yet Comprehensive Guide,"arXiv:2502.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated significant potential across various safety-critical applications, yet ensuring its robustness remains a key challenge. While adversarial robustness has been extensively studied in worst-case scenarios, probabilistic robustness (PR) offers a more practical perspective by quantifying the likelihood of failures under stochastic perturbations. This paper provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of PR, covering its formal definitions, evaluation and enhancement methods. We introduce a reformulated ''min-max'' optimisation framework for adversarial training specifically designed to improve PR. Furthermore, we explore the integration of PR verification evidence into system-level safety assurance, addressing challenges in translating DL model-level robustness to system-level claims. Finally, we highlight open research questions, including benchmarking PR evaluation methods, extending PR to generative AI tasks, and developing rigorous methodologies and case studies for system-level integration.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14833,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning,"arXiv:2502.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given inputs of diverse soil characteristics and climate data gathered from various regions, we aimed to build a model to predict accurate land emissions. The problem is important since accurate quantification of the carbon cycle in agroecosystems is crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring sustainable food production. Predicting accurate land emissions is challenging since calibrating the heterogeneous nature of soil properties, moisture, and environmental conditions is hard at decision-relevant scales. Traditional approaches do not adequately estimate land emissions due to location-independent parameters failing to leverage the spatial heterogeneity and also require large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we proposed Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (SDSA-KGML), which leverages location-dependent parameters that account for significant spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture from multiple sites within the same region. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSA-KGML models achieve higher local accuracy for the specified states in the Midwest Region.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14840,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Towards a perturbation-based explanation for medical AI as differentiable programs,"arXiv:2502.14001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancement in machine learning algorithms reaches a point where medical devices can be equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) models for diagnostic support and routine automation in clinical settings. In medicine and healthcare, there is a particular demand for sufficient and objective explainability of the outcome generated by AI models. However, AI models are generally considered as black boxes due to their complexity, and the computational process leading to their response is often opaque. Although several methods have been proposed to explain the behavior of models by evaluating the importance of each feature in discrimination and prediction, they may suffer from biases and opacities arising from the scale and sampling protocol of the dataset used for training or testing. To overcome the shortcomings of existing methods, we explore an alternative approach to provide an objective explanation of AI models that can be defined independently of the learning process and does not require additional data. As a preliminary study for this direction of research, this work examines a numerical availability of the Jacobian matrix of deep learning models that measures how stably a model responses against small perturbations added to the input. The indicator, if available, are calculated from a trained AI model for a given target input. This is a first step towards a perturbation-based explanation, which will assist medical practitioners in understanding and interpreting the response of the AI model in its clinical application.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14001,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Enhancing Cognition and Explainability of Multimodal Foundation Models with Self-Synthesized Data,"arXiv:2502.14044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown impressive capabilities in a wide range of visual tasks. However, they often struggle with fine-grained visual reasoning, failing to identify domain-specific objectives and provide justifiable explanations for their predictions. To address this, we propose a novel visual rejection sampling framework to improve the cognition and explainability of LMMs using self-synthesized data. Specifically, visual fine-tuning requires images, queries, and target answers. Our approach begins by synthesizing interpretable answers that include human-verifiable visual features. These features are based on expert-defined concepts, carefully selected based on their alignment with the image content. After each round of fine-tuning, we apply a reward model-free filtering mechanism to select the highest-quality interpretable answers for the next round of tuning. This iterative process of data synthesis and fine-tuning progressively improves the model's ability to generate accurate and reasonable explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving both the accuracy and explainability of specialized visual classification tasks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14044,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Effects of Prompt Length on Domain-specific Tasks for Large Language Models,"arXiv:2502.14255v1 Announce Type: cross

To address such challenges, researchers design various prompts to unlock the models' abilities. By carefully crafting input prompts, researchers can guide these models to produce more accurate responses. Consequently, prompt engineering has become a key focus of study. Despite the advancements in both models and prompt engineering, the relationship between the two-specifically, how prompt design impacts models' ability to perform domain-specific tasks-remains underexplored.

An Evaluation of Sakana's AI Scientist for Autonomous Research: Wishful Thinking or an Emerging Reality Towards 'Artificial General Research Intelligence' (AGRI)?,"arXiv:2502.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Super Intelligence is AI's ability to autonomously conduct research - what we term Artificial General Research Intelligence (AGRI). If machines could generate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and write research papers without human intervention, it would transform science. Recently, Sakana.ai introduced the AI Scientist, a system claiming to automate the research lifecycle, generating both excitement and skepticism.
  We evaluated the AI Scientist and found it a milestone in AI-driven research. While it streamlines some aspects, it falls short of expectations. Literature reviews are weak, nearly half the experiments failed, and manuscripts sometimes contain hallucinated results. Most notably, users must provide an experimental pipeline, limiting the AI Scientist's autonomy in research design and execution.
  Despite its limitations, the AI Scientist advances research automation. Many reviewers or instructors who assess work superficially may not recognize its output as AI-generated. The system produces research papers with minimal human effort and low cost. Our analysis suggests a paper costs a few USD with a few hours of human involvement, making it significantly faster than human researchers. Compared to AI capabilities from a few years ago, this marks progress toward AGRI.
  The rise of AI-driven research systems requires urgent discussion within Information Retrieval (IR) and broader scientific communities. Enhancing literature retrieval, citation validation, and evaluation benchmarks could improve AI-generated research reliability. We propose concrete steps, including AGRI-specific benchmarks, refined peer review, and standardized attribution frameworks.

Optimize Cardinality Estimation Model Pretraining by Simplifying the Training Datasets,"arXiv:2502.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cardinality estimation is a key aspect of query optimization research, and its performance has significantly improved with the integration of machine learning. To overcome the ""cold start"" problem or the lack of model transferability in learned cardinality estimators, some pre-training cardinality estimation models have been proposed that use learning across multiple datasets and corresponding workloads. These models typically train on a dataset created by uniformly sampling from many datasets, but this approach may not be optimal. By applying the Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (Group DRO) algorithm to training datasets, we find that some specific training datasets contribute more significantly to model performance than others. Based on this observation, we conduct extensive experiments to delve deeper into pre-training cardinality estimators. Our results show how the performance of these models can be influenced by the datasets and corresponding workloads. Finally, we introduce a simplified training dataset, which has been reduced to a fraction of the size of existing pretraining datasets. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that the pre-trained cardinality estimator based on this simplified dataset can still achieve comparable performance to existing models in zero-shot setups.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14350,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
A Macro- and Micro-Hierarchical Transfer Learning Framework for Cross-Domain Fake News Detection,"arXiv:2502.14403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain fake news detection aims to mitigate domain shift and improve detection performance by transferring knowledge across domains. Existing approaches transfer knowledge based on news content and user engagements from a source domain to a target domain. However, these approaches face two main limitations, hindering effective knowledge transfer and optimal fake news detection performance. Firstly, from a micro perspective, they neglect the negative impact of veracity-irrelevant features in news content when transferring domain-shared features across domains. Secondly, from a macro perspective, existing approaches ignore the relationship between user engagement and news content, which reveals shared behaviors of common users across domains and can facilitate more effective knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose a novel macro- and micro- hierarchical transfer learning framework (MMHT) for cross-domain fake news detection. Firstly, we propose a micro-hierarchical disentangling module to disentangle veracity-relevant and veracity-irrelevant features from news content in the source domain for improving fake news detection performance in the target domain. Secondly, we propose a macro-hierarchical transfer learning module to generate engagement features based on common users' shared behaviors in different domains for improving effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14403,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Reliable Explainability of Deep Learning Spatial-Spectral Classifiers for Improved Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving,"arXiv:2502.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating hyperspectral imagery (HSI) with deep neural networks (DNNs) can strengthen the accuracy of intelligent vision systems by combining spectral and spatial information, which is useful for tasks like semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To advance research in such safety-critical systems, determining the precise contribution of spectral information to complex DNNs' output is needed. To address this, several saliency methods, such as class activation maps (CAM), have been proposed primarily for image classification. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding their reliability. In this paper, we address their limitations and propose an alternative approach by leveraging the data provided by activations and weights from relevant DNN layers to better capture the relationship between input features and predictions. The study aims to assess the superior performance of HSI compared to 3-channel and single-channel DNNs. We also address the influence of spectral signature normalization for enhancing DNN robustness in real-world driving conditions.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14416,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: While deep learning methods have shown great promise in improving the effectiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis by detecting suspicious lesions from trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS), they must overcome multiple simultaneous challenges. There is high heterogeneity in tissue appearance, significant class imbalance in favor of benign examples, and scarcity in the number and quality of ground truth annotations available to train models. Failure to address even a single one of these problems can result in unacceptable clinical outcomes.We propose TRUSWorthy, a carefully designed, tuned, and integrated system for reliable PCa detection. Our pipeline integrates self-supervised learning, multiple-instance learning aggregation using transformers, random-undersampled boosting and ensembling: these address label scarcity, weak labels, class imbalance, and overconfidence, respectively. We train and rigorously evaluate our method using a large, multi-center dataset of micro-ultrasound data. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of accuracy and uncertainty calibration, with AUROC and balanced accuracy scores of 79.9% and 71.5%, respectively. On the top 20% of predictions with the highest confidence, we can achieve a balanced accuracy of up to 91%. The success of TRUSWorthy demonstrates the potential of integrated deep learning solutions to meet clinical needs in a highly challenging deployment setting, and is a significant step towards creating a trustworthy system for computer-assisted PCa diagnosis.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14707,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Data-Efficient Pretraining with Group-Level Data Influence Modeling,"arXiv:2502.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-efficient pretraining has shown tremendous potential to elevate scaling laws. This paper argues that effective pretraining data should be curated at the group level, treating a set of data points as a whole rather than as independent contributors. To achieve that, we propose Group-Level Data Influence Modeling (Group-MATES), a novel data-efficient pretraining method that captures and optimizes group-level data utility. Specifically, Group-MATES collects oracle group-level influences by locally probing the pretraining model with data sets. It then fine-tunes a relational data influence model to approximate oracles as relationship-weighted aggregations of individual influences. The fine-tuned model selects the data subset by maximizing its group-level influence prediction, with influence-aware clustering to enable efficient inference. Experiments on the DCLM benchmark demonstrate that Group-MATES achieves a 10% relative core score improvement on 22 downstream tasks over DCLM-Baseline and 5% over individual-influence-based methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Further analyses highlight the effectiveness of relational data influence models in capturing intricate interactions between data points.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14709,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Internal Incoherency Scores for Constraint-based Causal Discovery Algorithms,"arXiv:2502.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery aims to infer causal graphs from observational or experimental data. Methods such as the popular PC algorithm are based on conditional independence testing and utilize enabling assumptions, such as the faithfulness assumption, for their inferences. In practice, these assumptions, as well as the functional assumptions inherited from the chosen conditional independence test, are typically taken as a given and not further tested for their validity on the data. In this work, we propose internal coherency scores that allow testing for assumption violations and finite sample errors, whenever detectable without requiring ground truth or further statistical tests. We provide a complete classification of erroneous results, including a distinction between detectable and undetectable errors, and prove that the detectable erroneous results can be measured by our scores. We illustrate our coherency scores on the PC algorithm with simulated and real-world datasets, and envision that testing for internal coherency can become a standard tool in applying constraint-based methods, much like a suite of tests is used to validate the assumptions of classical regression analysis.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14719,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Beyond Performance Scores: Directed Functional Connectivity as a Brain-Based Biomarker for Motor Skill Learning and Retention,"arXiv:2502.14731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor skill acquisition in fields like surgery, robotics, and sports involves learning complex task sequences through extensive training. Traditional performance metrics, like execution time and error rates, offer limited insight as they fail to capture the neural mechanisms underlying skill learning and retention. This study introduces directed functional connectivity (dFC), derived from electroencephalography (EEG), as a novel brain-based biomarker for assessing motor skill learning and retention. For the first time, dFC is applied as a biomarker to map the stages of the Fitts and Posner motor learning model, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying skill acquisition and retention. Unlike traditional measures, it captures both the strength and direction of neural information flow, providing a comprehensive understanding of neural adaptations across different learning stages. The analysis demonstrates that dFC can effectively identify and track the progression through various stages of the Fitts and Posner model. Furthermore, its stability over a six-week washout period highlights its utility in monitoring long-term retention. No significant changes in dFC were observed in a control group, confirming that the observed neural adaptations were specific to training and not due to external factors. By offering a granular view of the learning process at the group and individual levels, dFC facilitates the development of personalized, targeted training protocols aimed at enhancing outcomes in fields where precision and long-term retention are critical, such as surgical education. These findings underscore the value of dFC as a robust biomarker that complements traditional performance metrics, providing a deeper understanding of motor skill learning and retention.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14731,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Optimizing Model Selection for Compound AI Systems,"arXiv:2502.14815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound AI systems that combine multiple LLM calls, such as self-refine and multi-agent-debate, achieve strong performance on many AI tasks. We address a core question in optimizing compound systems: for each LLM call or module in the system, how should one decide which LLM to use? We show that these LLM choices have a large effect on quality, but the search space is exponential. We propose LLMSelector, an efficient framework for model selection in compound systems, which leverages two key empirical insights: (i) end-to-end performance is often monotonic in how well each module performs, with all other modules held fixed, and (ii) per-module performance can be estimated accurately by an LLM. Building upon these insights, LLMSelector iteratively selects one module and allocates to it the model with the highest module-wise performance, as estimated by an LLM, until no further gain is possible. LLMSelector is applicable to any compound system with a bounded number of modules, and its number of API calls scales linearly with the number of modules, achieving high-quality model allocation both empirically and theoretically. Experiments with popular compound systems such as multi-agent debate and self-refine using LLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 show that LLMSelector confers 5%-70% accuracy gains compared to using the same LLM for all modules.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14815,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Conditional Generative Models,"arXiv:2204.12833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial in training deep neural networks on new target tasks. Current transfer learning methods always assume at least one of (i) source and target task label spaces overlap, (ii) source datasets are available, and (iii) target network architectures are consistent with source ones. However, holding these assumptions is difficult in practical settings because the target task rarely has the same labels as the source task, the source dataset access is restricted due to storage costs and privacy, and the target architecture is often specialized to each task. To transfer source knowledge without these assumptions, we propose a transfer learning method that uses deep generative models and is composed of the following two stages: pseudo pre-training (PP) and pseudo semi-supervised learning (P-SSL). PP trains a target architecture with an artificial dataset synthesized by using conditional source generative models. P-SSL applies SSL algorithms to labeled target data and unlabeled pseudo samples, which are generated by cascading the source classifier and generative models to condition them with target samples. Our experimental results indicate that our method can outperform the baselines of scratch training and knowledge distillation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12833,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
SEA: Shareable and Explainable Attribution for Query-based Black-box Attacks,"arXiv:2308.11845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, particularly those from query-based black-box attacks. Despite various efforts to detect and prevent such attacks, ML systems are still at risk, demanding a more comprehensive approach to security that includes logging, analyzing, and sharing evidence. While traditional security benefits from well-established practices of forensics and threat intelligence sharing, ML security has yet to find a way to profile its attackers and share information about them. In response, this paper introduces SEA, a novel ML security system to characterize black-box attacks on ML systems for forensic purposes and to facilitate human-explainable intelligence sharing. SEA leverages Hidden Markov Models to attribute the observed query sequence to known attacks. It thus understands the attack's progression rather than focusing solely on the final adversarial examples. Our evaluations reveal that SEA is effective at attack attribution, even on the second incident, and is robust to adaptive strategies designed to evade forensic analysis. SEA's explanations of the attack's behavior allow us even to fingerprint specific minor bugs in widely used attack libraries. For example, we discover that the SignOPT and Square attacks in ART v1.14 send over 50% duplicated queries. We thoroughly evaluate SEA on a variety of settings and demonstrate that it can recognize the same attack with more than 90% Top-1 and 95% Top-3 accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how SEA generalizes to other domains like text classification.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11845,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Efficiently Training Deep-Learning Parametric Policies using Lagrangian Duality,"arXiv:2405.14973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are critical in many high-stakes applications, where decisions must optimize cumulative rewards while strictly adhering to complex nonlinear constraints. In domains such as power systems, finance, supply chains, and precision robotics, violating these constraints can result in significant financial or societal costs. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often struggle with sample efficiency and effectiveness in finding feasible policies for highly and strictly constrained CMDPs, limiting their applicability in these environments. Stochastic dual dynamic programming is often used in practice on convex relaxations of the original problem, but they also encounter computational challenges and loss of optimality. This paper introduces a novel approach, Two-Stage Deep Decision Rules (TS-DDR), to efficiently train parametric actor policies using Lagrangian Duality. TS-DDR is a self-supervised learning algorithm that trains general decision rules (parametric policies) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD); its forward passes solve {\em deterministic} optimization problems to find feasible policies, and its backward passes leverage duality theory to train the parametric policy with closed-form gradients. TS-DDR inherits the flexibility and computational performance of deep learning methodologies to solve CMDP problems. Applied to the Long-Term Hydrothermal Dispatch (LTHD) problem using actual power system data from Bolivia, TS-DDR is shown to enhance solution quality and to reduce computation times by several orders of magnitude when compared to current state-of-the-art methods.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14973,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
A domain decomposition-based autoregressive deep learning model for unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations,"arXiv:2408.14461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a domain-decomposition-based deep learning (DL) framework, named transient-CoMLSim, for accurately modeling unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The framework consists of two key components: (a) a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoencoder architecture and (b) an autoregressive model composed of fully connected layers. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods that operate on the entire computational domain, our CNN-based autoencoder computes a lower-dimensional basis for solution and condition fields represented on subdomains. Timestepping is performed entirely in the latent space, generating embeddings of the solution variables from the time history of embeddings of solution and condition variables. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also enhances scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale simulations. Furthermore, to improve the stability of our rollouts, we employ a curriculum learning (CL) approach during the training of the autoregressive model. The domain-decomposition strategy enables scaling to out-of-distribution domain sizes while maintaining the accuracy of predictions -- a feature not easily integrated into popular DL-based approaches for physics simulations. We benchmark our model against two widely-used DL architectures, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and U-Net, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms them in terms of accuracy, extrapolation to unseen timesteps, and stability for a wide range of use cases.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14461,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Sharpness-Aware Minimization Efficiently Selects Flatter Minima Late in Training,"arXiv:2410.10373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has substantially improved the generalization of neural networks under various settings. Despite the success, its effectiveness remains poorly understood. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon in the training dynamics of SAM, shedding light on understanding its implicit bias towards flatter minima over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Specifically, we find that SAM efficiently selects flatter minima late in training. Remarkably, even a few epochs of SAM applied at the end of training yield nearly the same generalization and solution sharpness as full SAM training. Subsequently, we delve deeper into the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon. Theoretically, we identify two phases in the learning dynamics after applying SAM late in training: i) SAM first escapes the minimum found by SGD exponentially fast; and ii) then rapidly converges to a flatter minimum within the same valley. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the role of SAM during the early training phase. We conjecture that the optimization method chosen in the late phase is more crucial in shaping the final solution's properties. Based on this viewpoint, we extend our findings from SAM to Adversarial Training.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10373,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?,"arXiv:2410.21676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size (CBS), concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control of factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21676,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Towards counterfactual fairness through auxiliary variables,"arXiv:2412.04767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of balancing fairness and predictive accuracy in machine learning models, especially when sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age are considered, has motivated substantial research in recent years. Counterfactual fairness ensures that predictions remain consistent across counterfactual variations of sensitive attributes, which is a crucial concept in addressing societal biases. However, existing counterfactual fairness approaches usually overlook intrinsic information about sensitive features, limiting their ability to achieve fairness while simultaneously maintaining performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce EXOgenous Causal reasoning (EXOC), a novel causal reasoning framework motivated by exogenous variables. It leverages auxiliary variables to uncover intrinsic properties that give rise to sensitive attributes. Our framework explicitly defines an auxiliary node and a control node that contribute to counterfactual fairness and control the information flow within the model. Our evaluation, conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, validates EXOC's superiority, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in achieving counterfactual fairness.

Are DeepSeek R1 And Other Reasoning Models More Faithful?,"arXiv:2501.08156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. A key question emerges: Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? To investigate this, we evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue ""A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D"" is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the influence of this cue 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses - which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness - whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08156,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: The drastic changes in the global economy, geopolitical conditions, and disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the cost of living and quality of life. It is important to understand the long-term nature of the cost of living and quality of life in major economies. A transparent and comprehensive living index must include multiple dimensions of living conditions. In this study, we present an approach to quantifying the quality of life through the Global Ease of Living Index that combines various socio-economic and infrastructural factors into a single composite score. Our index utilises economic indicators that define living standards, which could help in targeted interventions to improve specific areas. We present a machine learning framework for addressing the problem of missing data for some of the economic indicators for specific countries. We then curate and update the data and use a dimensionality reduction approach (principal component analysis) to create the Ease of Living Index for major economies since 1970. Our work significantly adds to the literature by offering a practical tool for policymakers to identify areas needing improvement, such as healthcare systems, employment opportunities, and public safety. Our approach with open data and code can be easily reproduced and applied to various contexts.

Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning,"arXiv:2312.04398v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Extracting Sentence Embeddings from Pretrained Transformer Models,"arXiv:2408.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained transformer models shine in many natural language processing tasks and therefore are expected to bear the representation of the input sentence or text meaning. These sentence-level embeddings are also important in retrieval-augmented generation. But do commonly used plain averaging or prompt templates sufficiently capture and represent the underlying meaning? After providing a comprehensive review of existing sentence embedding extraction and refinement methods, we thoroughly test different combinations and our original extensions of the most promising ones on pretrained models. Namely, given 110 M parameters, BERT's hidden representations from multiple layers, and many tokens, we try diverse ways to extract optimal sentence embeddings. We test various token aggregation and representation post-processing techniques. We also test multiple ways of using a general Wikitext dataset to complement BERT's sentence embeddings. All methods are tested on eight Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), six short text clustering, and twelve classification tasks. We also evaluate our representation-shaping techniques on other static models, including random token representations. Proposed representation extraction methods improve the performance on STS and clustering tasks for all models considered. Very high improvements for static token-based models, especially random embeddings for STS tasks, almost reach the performance of BERT-derived representations. Our work shows that the representation-shaping techniques significantly improve sentence embeddings extracted from BERT-based and simple baseline models.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08073,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
STAR: A Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendations using Large Language Models,"arXiv:2410.16458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) offers promising new approaches for recommendation system tasks. While the current state-of-the-art methods rely on fine-tuning LLMs to achieve optimal results, this process is costly and introduces significant engineering complexities. Conversely, methods that directly use LLMs without additional fine-tuning result in a large drop in recommendation quality, often due to the inability to capture collaborative information. In this paper, we propose a Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendation (STAR), a framework that utilizes LLMs and can be applied to various recommendation tasks without the need for fine-tuning, while maintaining high quality recommendation performance. Our approach involves a retrieval stage that uses semantic embeddings from LLMs combined with collaborative user information to retrieve candidate items. We then apply an LLM for pairwise ranking to enhance next-item prediction. Experimental results on the Amazon Review dataset show competitive performance for next item prediction, even with our retrieval stage alone. Our full method achieves Hits@10 performance of +23.8% on Beauty, +37.5% on Toys & Games, and -1.8% on Sports & Outdoors relative to the best supervised models. This framework offers an effective alternative to traditional supervised models, highlighting the potential of LLMs in recommendation systems without extensive training or custom architectures.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16458,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score.

The dark side of the forces: assessing non-conservative force models for atomistic machine learning,"arXiv:2412.11569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to estimate the energy of a group of atoms, and the forces that drive them to more stable configurations, have revolutionized the fields of computational chemistry and materials discovery. In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically-constrained approach, suggesting that using the forces as explicit learning targets yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency - and that energy conservation can be learned during training. The present work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Contrary to the case of rotational symmetry, lack of energy conservation is hard to learn, control, and correct. The best approach to exploit the acceleration afforded by direct force evaluation might be to use it in tandem with a conservative model, reducing - rather than eliminating - the additional cost of backpropagation, but avoiding most of the pathological behavior associated with non-conservative forces.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11569,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Learning to Play Against Unknown Opponents,"arXiv:2412.18297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a learning agent who has to repeatedly play a general sum game against a strategic opponent who acts to maximize their own payoff by optimally responding against the learner's algorithm. The learning agent knows their own payoff function, but is uncertain about the payoff of their opponent (knowing only that it is drawn from some distribution $\mathcal{D}$). What learning algorithm should the agent run in order to maximize their own total utility, either in expectation or in the worst-case over $\mathcal{D}$?
  When the learning algorithm is constrained to be a no-regret algorithm, we demonstrate how to efficiently construct an optimal learning algorithm (asymptotically achieving the optimal utility) in polynomial time for both the in-expectation and worst-case problems, independent of any other assumptions. When the learning algorithm is not constrained to no-regret, we show how to construct an $\varepsilon$-optimal learning algorithm (obtaining average utility within $\varepsilon$ of the optimal utility) for both the in-expectation and worst-case problems in time polynomial in the size of the input and $1/\varepsilon$, when either the size of the game or the support of $\mathcal{D}$ is constant. Finally, for the special case of the maximin objective, where the learner wishes to maximize their minimum payoff over all possible optimizer types, we construct a learner algorithm that runs in polynomial time in each step and guarantees convergence to the optimal learner payoff. All of these results make use of recently developed machinery that converts the analysis of learning algorithms to the study of the class of corresponding geometric objects known as menus.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18297,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: The integrity of time series data in smart grids is often compromised by missing values due to sensor failures, transmission errors, or disruptions. Gaps in smart meter data can bias consumption analyses and hinder reliable predictions, causing technical and economic inefficiencies. As smart meter data grows in volume and complexity, conventional techniques struggle with its nonlinear and nonstationary patterns. In this context, Generative Artificial Intelligence offers promising solutions that may outperform traditional statistical methods. In this paper, we evaluate two general-purpose Large Language Models and five Time Series Foundation Models for smart meter data imputation, comparing them with conventional Machine Learning and statistical models. We introduce artificial gaps (30 minutes to one day) into an anonymized public dataset to test inference capabilities. Results show that Time Series Foundation Models, with their contextual understanding and pattern recognition, could significantly enhance imputation accuracy in certain cases.

Reasoning Bias of Next Token Prediction Training,"arXiv:2502.02007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of Large Language Models (LLMs), the quest to efficiently train them for superior reasoning capabilities has been a pivotal challenge. The dominant training paradigm for LLMs is based on next token prediction (NTP). Alternative methodologies, called Critical Token Prediction (CTP), focused exclusively on specific critical tokens (such as the answer in Q\&A dataset), aiming to reduce the overfitting of extraneous information and noise. Contrary to initial assumptions, our research reveals that despite NTP's exposure to noise during training, it surpasses CTP in reasoning ability. We attribute this counterintuitive outcome to the regularizing influence of noise on the training dynamics. Our empirical analysis shows that NTP-trained models exhibit enhanced generalization and robustness across various benchmark reasoning datasets, demonstrating greater resilience to perturbations and achieving flatter loss minima. These findings illuminate that NTP is instrumental in fostering reasoning abilities during pretraining, whereas CTP is more effective for finetuning, thereby enriching our comprehension of optimal training strategies in LLM development.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02007,"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
