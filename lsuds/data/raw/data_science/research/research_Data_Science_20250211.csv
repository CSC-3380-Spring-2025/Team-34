Adversarial Machine Learning: Attacking and Safeguarding Image Datasets,"arXiv:2502.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the vulnerabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to adversarial attacks and explores a method for their safeguarding. In this study, CNNs were implemented on four of the most common image datasets, namely CIFAR-10, ImageNet, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, and achieved high baseline accuracy. To assess the strength of these models, the Fast Gradient Sign Method was used, which is a type of exploit on the model that is used to bring down the models accuracies by adding a very minimal perturbation to the input image. To counter the FGSM attack, a safeguarding approach went through, which includes retraining the models on clear and pollutant or adversarial images to increase their resistance ability. The next step involves applying FGSM again, but this time to the adversarially trained models, to see how much the accuracy of the models has gone down and evaluate the effectiveness of the defense. It appears that while most level of robustness is achieved against the models after adversarial training, there are still a few losses in the performance of these models against adversarial perturbations. This work emphasizes the need to create better defenses for models deployed in real-world scenarios against adversaries.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05203,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Fairness and Sparsity within Rashomon sets: Enumeration-Free Exploration and Characterization,"arXiv:2502.05286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an enumeration-free method based on mathematical programming to precisely characterize various properties such as fairness or sparsity within the set of ""good models"", known as Rashomon set. This approach is generically applicable to any hypothesis class, provided that a mathematical formulation of the model learning task exists. It offers a structured framework to define the notion of business necessity and evaluate how fairness can be improved or degraded towards a specific protected group, while remaining within the Rashomon set and maintaining any desired sparsity level.
  We apply our approach to two hypothesis classes: scoring systems and decision diagrams, leveraging recent mathematical programming formulations for training such models. As seen in our experiments, the method comprehensively and certifiably quantifies trade-offs between predictive performance, sparsity, and fairness. We observe that a wide range of fairness values are attainable, ranging from highly favorable to significantly unfavorable for a protected group, while staying within less than 1% of the best possible training accuracy for the hypothesis class. Additionally, we observe that sparsity constraints limit these trade-offs and may disproportionately harm specific subgroups. As we evidenced, thoroughly characterizing the tensions between these key aspects is critical for an informed and accountable selection of models.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05286,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Parameter Symmetry Breaking and Restoration Determines the Hierarchical Learning in AI Systems,"arXiv:2502.05300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of learning in modern large AI systems is hierarchical, often characterized by abrupt, qualitative shifts akin to phase transitions observed in physical systems. While these phenomena hold promise for uncovering the mechanisms behind neural networks and language models, existing theories remain fragmented, addressing specific cases. In this paper, we posit that parameter symmetry breaking and restoration serve as a unifying mechanism underlying these behaviors. We synthesize prior observations and show how this mechanism explains three distinct hierarchies in neural networks: learning dynamics, model complexity, and representation formation. By connecting these hierarchies, we highlight symmetry -- a cornerstone of theoretical physics -- as a potential fundamental principle in modern AI.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05300,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Training Set Reconstruction from Differentially Private Forests: How Effective is DP?,"arXiv:2502.05307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to privacy attacks targeting their training data. Differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted countermeasure, as it offers rigorous privacy protections.
  In this paper, we introduce a reconstruction attack targeting state-of-the-art $\varepsilon$-DP random forests. By leveraging a constraint programming model that incorporates knowledge of the forest's structure and DP mechanism characteristics, our approach formally reconstructs the most likely dataset that could have produced a given forest.
  Through extensive computational experiments, we examine the interplay between model utility, privacy guarantees, and reconstruction accuracy across various configurations. Our results reveal that random forests trained with meaningful DP guarantees can still leak substantial portions of their training data. Specifically, while DP reduces the success of reconstruction attacks, the only forests fully robust to our attack exhibit predictive performance no better than a constant classifier. Building on these insights, we provide practical recommendations for the construction of DP random forests that are more resilient to reconstruction attacks and maintain non-trivial predictive performance.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05307,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
AI/ML-Based Automatic Modulation Recognition: Recent Trends and Future Possibilities,"arXiv:2502.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a review of high-performance automatic modulation recognition (AMR) models proposed in the literature to classify various Radio Frequency (RF) modulation schemes. We replicated these models and compared their performance in terms of accuracy across a range of signal-to-noise ratios. To ensure a fair comparison, we used the same dataset (RadioML-2016A), the same hardware, and a consistent definition of test accuracy as the evaluation metric, thereby providing a benchmark for future AMR studies. The hyperparameters were selected based on the authors' suggestions in the associated references to achieve results as close as possible to the originals. The replicated models are publicly accessible for further analysis of AMR models. We also present the test accuracies of the selected models versus their number of parameters, indicating their complexities. Building on this comparative analysis, we identify strategies to enhance these models' performance. Finally, we present potential opportunities for improvement, whether through novel architectures, data processing techniques, or training strategies, to further advance the capabilities of AMR models.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05315,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Using Federated Machine Learning in Predictive Maintenance of Jet Engines,"arXiv:2502.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbine jet engines using a federated machine learning framework. Federated Learning enables multiple edge devices/nodes or servers to collaboratively train a shared model without sharing sensitive data, thus preserving data privacy and security. By implementing a nonlinear model, the system aims to capture complex relationships and patterns in the engine data to enhance the accuracy of RUL predictions. This approach leverages decentralized computation, allowing models to be trained locally at each device before aggregating the learned weights at a central server. By predicting the RUL of jet engines accurately, maintenance schedules can be optimized, downtime reduced, and operational efficiency improved, ultimately leading to cost savings and enhanced performance in the aviation industry. Computational results are provided by using the C-MAPSS dataset which is publicly available on the NASA website and is a valuable resource for studying and analyzing engine degradation behaviors in various operational scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05321,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Geometric Machine Learning on EEG Signals,"arXiv:2502.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer transformative potential, but decoding neural signals presents significant challenges. The core premise of this paper is built around demonstrating methods to elucidate the underlying low-dimensional geometric structure present in high-dimensional brainwave data in order to assist in downstream BCI-related neural classification tasks. We demonstrate two pipelines related to electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing: (1) a preliminary pipeline removing noise from individual EEG channels, and (2) a downstream manifold learning pipeline uncovering geometric structure across networks of EEG channels. We conduct preliminary validation using two EEG datasets and situate our demonstration in the context of the BCI-relevant imagined digit decoding problem. Our preliminary pipeline uses an attention-based EEG filtration network to extract clean signal from individual EEG channels. Our primary pipeline uses a fast Fourier transform, a Laplacian eigenmap, a discrete analog of Ricci flow via Ollivier's notion of Ricci curvature, and a graph convolutional network to perform dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional multi-channel EEG data in order to enable regularizable downstream classification. Our system achieves competitive performance with existing signal processing and classification benchmarks; we demonstrate a mean test correlation coefficient of >0.95 at 2 dB on semi-synthetic neural denoising and a downstream EEG-based classification accuracy of 0.97 on distinguishing digit- versus non-digit thoughts. Results are preliminary and our geometric machine learning pipeline should be validated by more extensive follow-up studies; generalizing these results to larger inter-subject sample sizes, different hardware systems, and broader use cases will be crucial.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05334,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
fMoE: Fine-Grained Expert Offloading for Large Mixture-of-Experts Serving,"arXiv:2502.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained immense success in revolutionizing various applications, including content generation, search and recommendation, and AI-assisted operation. To reduce high training costs, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a popular backbone for modern LLMs. However, despite the benefits, serving MoE-based LLMs experience severe memory inefficiency due to sparsely activated experts. Recent studies propose to offload inactive experts from GPU memory to CPU memory to improve the serving efficiency of MoE models. However, they either incur high inference latency or high model memory footprints due to coarse-grained designs. To tame the latency-memory trade-off in MoE serving, we present fMoE, a fine-grained expert offloading system for MoE serving that achieves low inference latency with memory efficiency. We design fMoE to extract fine-grained expert selection patterns from MoE models and semantic hints from input prompts to efficiently guide expert prefetching, caching, and offloading decisions. fMoE is prototyped on top of HuggingFace Transformers and deployed on a six-GPU testbed. Experiments with open-source MoE models and real-world workloads show that fMoE reduces inference latency by 47% and improves expert hit rate by 36% over state-of-the-art solutions.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05370,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Deep Generative Models with Hard Linear Equality Constraints,"arXiv:2502.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep generative models~(DGMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions, they consistently fail to learn constraints that encode domain knowledge and thus require constraint integration. Existing solutions to this challenge have primarily relied on heuristic methods and often ignore the underlying data distribution, harming the generative performance. In this work, we propose a probabilistically sound approach for enforcing the hard constraints into DGMs to generate constraint-compliant and realistic data. This is achieved by our proposed gradient estimators that allow the constrained distribution, the data distribution conditioned on constraints, to be differentiably learned. We carry out extensive experiments with various DGM model architectures over five image datasets and three scientific applications in which domain knowledge is governed by linear equality constraints. We validate that the standard DGMs almost surely generate data violating the constraints. Among all the constraint integration strategies, ours not only guarantees the satisfaction of constraints in generation but also archives superior generative performance than the other methods across every benchmark.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05416,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution: Training Diffusion Models with Finite Noisy Datasets,"arXiv:2502.05446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent diffusion-based generative models achieve remarkable results by training on massive datasets, yet this practice raises concerns about memorization and copyright infringement. A proposed remedy is to train exclusively on noisy data with potential copyright issues, ensuring the model never observes original content. However, through the lens of deconvolution theory, we show that although it is theoretically feasible to learn the data distribution from noisy samples, the practical challenge of collecting sufficient samples makes successful learning nearly unattainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose to pretrain the model with a small fraction of clean data to guide the deconvolution process. Combined with our Stochastic Forward--Backward Deconvolution (SFBD) method, we attain an FID of $6.31$ on CIFAR-10 with just $4\%$ clean images (and $3.58$ with $10\%$). Theoretically, we prove that SFBD guides the model to learn the true data distribution. The result also highlights the importance of pretraining on limited but clean data or the alternative from similar datasets. Empirical studies further support these findings and offer additional insights.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05446,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
You Are What You Eat -- AI Alignment Requires Understanding How Data Shapes Structure and Generalisation,"arXiv:2502.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this position paper, we argue that understanding the relation between structure in the data distribution and structure in trained models is central to AI alignment. First, we discuss how two neural networks can have equivalent performance on the training set but compute their outputs in essentially different ways and thus generalise differently. For this reason, standard testing and evaluation are insufficient for obtaining assurances of safety for widely deployed generally intelligent systems. We argue that to progress beyond evaluation to a robust mathematical science of AI alignment, we need to develop statistical foundations for an understanding of the relation between structure in the data distribution, internal structure in models, and how these structures underlie generalisation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05475,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Modeling of Core Loss Based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning,"arXiv:2502.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a Mix Neural Network (MNN) based on CNN-FCNN for predicting magnetic loss of different materials. In traditional magnetic core loss models, empirical equations usually need to be regressed under the same external conditions. When the magnetic core material is different, it needs to be classified and discussed. If external factors increase, multiple models need to be proposed for classification and discussion, making the modeling process extremely cumbersome. And traditional empirical equations still has the problem of low accuracy, although various correction equations have been introduced later, the accuracy has always been unsatisfactory. By introducing machine learning and deep learning, it is possible to simultaneously solve prediction problems with low accuracy of empirical equations and complex conditions. Based on the MagNet database, through the training of the newly proposed MNN, it is found that a single model is sufficient to make predictions for at least four different materials under varying temperatures, frequencies, and waveforms, with accuracy far exceeding that of traditional models. At the same time, we also used three other machine learning and deep learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP-LSTM) for training, all of which had much higher accuracy than traditional models. On the basis of the predicted results, a hybrid model combining MNN and XGBoost was proposed, which predicted through weighting and found that the accuracy could continue to improve. This provides a solution for modeling magnetic core loss under different materials and operating modes.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05487,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Democratic Training Against Universal Adversarial Perturbations,"arXiv:2502.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their advances and success, real-world deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Universal adversarial perturbation, an input-agnostic attack, poses a serious threat for them to be deployed in security-sensitive systems. In this case, a single universal adversarial perturbation deceives the model on a range of clean inputs without requiring input-specific optimization, which makes it particularly threatening. In this work, we observe that universal adversarial perturbations usually lead to abnormal entropy spectrum in hidden layers, which suggests that the prediction is dominated by a small number of ``feature'' in such cases (rather than democratically by many features). Inspired by this, we propose an efficient yet effective defense method for mitigating UAPs called \emph{Democratic Training} by performing entropy-based model enhancement to suppress the effect of the universal adversarial perturbations in a given model. \emph{Democratic Training} is evaluated with 7 neural networks trained on 5 benchmark datasets and 5 types of state-of-the-art universal adversarial attack methods. The results show that it effectively reduces the attack success rate, improves model robustness and preserves the model accuracy on clean samples.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05542,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Training-Free Constrained Generation With Stable Diffusion Models,"arXiv:2502.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art in data synthesis across diverse domains and hold transformative potential for applications in science and engineering, e.g., by facilitating the discovery of novel solutions and simulating systems that are computationally intractable to model explicitly. However, their current utility in these fields is severely limited by an inability to enforce strict adherence to physical laws and domain-specific constraints. Without this grounding, the deployment of such models in critical applications, ranging from material science to safety-critical systems, remains impractical. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing a novel approach to integrate stable diffusion models with constrained optimization frameworks, enabling them to generate outputs that satisfy stringent physical and functional requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through material science experiments requiring adherence to precise morphometric properties, inverse design problems involving the generation of stress-strain responses using video generation with a simulator in the loop, and safety settings where outputs must avoid copyright infringement.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05625,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Mol-MoE: Training Preference-Guided Routers for Molecule Generation,"arXiv:2502.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models have enabled framing molecule generation as sequence modeling. However, existing approaches often rely on single-objective reinforcement learning, limiting their applicability to real-world drug design, where multiple competing properties must be optimized. Traditional multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) methods require costly retraining for each new objective combination, making rapid exploration of trade-offs impractical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Mol-MoE, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture that enables efficient test-time steering of molecule generation without retraining. Central to our approach is a preference-based router training objective that incentivizes the router to combine experts in a way that aligns with user-specified trade-offs. This provides improved flexibility in exploring the chemical property space at test time, facilitating rapid trade-off exploration. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, we show that Mol-MoE achieves superior sample quality and steerability.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05633,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
The late-stage training dynamics of (stochastic) subgradient descent on homogeneous neural networks,"arXiv:2502.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the implicit bias of constant step stochastic subgradient descent (SGD). We consider the setting of binary classification with homogeneous neural networks - a large class of deep neural networks with ReLU-type activation functions such as MLPs and CNNs without biases. We interpret the dynamics of normalized SGD iterates as an Euler-like discretization of a conservative field flow that is naturally associated to the normalized classification margin. Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training (i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth and stochastic setting. Our main result applies to binary classification with exponential or logistic losses. We additionally discuss extensions to more general settings.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05668,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization,"arXiv:2502.05722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05722,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
"Filter, Obstruct and Dilute: Defending Against Backdoor Attacks on Semi-Supervised Learning","arXiv:2502.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have verified that semi-supervised learning (SSL) is vulnerable to data poisoning backdoor attacks. Even a tiny fraction of contaminated training data is sufficient for adversaries to manipulate up to 90\% of the test outputs in existing SSL methods. Given the emerging threat of backdoor attacks designed for SSL, this work aims to protect SSL against such risks, marking it as one of the few known efforts in this area. Specifically, we begin by identifying that the spurious correlations between the backdoor triggers and the target class implanted by adversaries are the primary cause of manipulated model predictions during the test phase. To disrupt these correlations, we utilize three key techniques: Gaussian Filter, complementary learning and trigger mix-up, which collectively filter, obstruct and dilute the influence of backdoor attacks in both data pre-processing and feature learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, Backdoor Invalidator (BI), significantly reduces the average attack success rate from 84.7\% to 1.8\% across different state-of-the-art backdoor attacks. It is also worth mentioning that BI does not sacrifice accuracy on clean data and is supported by a theoretical guarantee of its generalization capability.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05755,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Predictive Crash Analytics for Traffic Safety using Deep Learning,"arXiv:2502.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional automated crash analysis systems heavily rely on static statistical models and historical data, requiring significant manual interpretation and lacking real-time predictive capabilities. This research presents an innovative approach to traffic safety analysis through the integration of ensemble learning methods and multi-modal data fusion for real-time crash risk assessment and prediction. Our primary contribution lies in developing a hierarchical severity classification system that combines spatial-temporal crash patterns with environmental conditions, achieving significant improvements over traditional statistical approaches. The system demonstrates a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.893, representing a 15% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods (baseline mAP: 0.776). We introduce a novel feature engineering technique that integrates crash location data with incident reports and weather conditions, achieving 92.4% accuracy in risk prediction and 89.7% precision in hotspot identification. Through extensive validation using 500,000 initial crash records filtered to 59,496 high-quality samples, our solution shows marked improvements in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

I3S: Importance Sampling Subspace Selection for Low-Rank Optimization in LLM Pretraining,"arXiv:2502.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising approach to enabling memory-efficient training of large language models (LLMs). Existing low-rank optimization methods typically project gradients onto a low-rank subspace, reducing the memory cost of storing optimizer states. A key challenge in these methods is identifying suitable subspaces to ensure an effective optimization trajectory. Most existing approaches select the dominant subspace to preserve gradient information, as this intuitively provides the best approximation. However, we find that in practice, the dominant subspace stops changing during pretraining, thereby constraining weight updates to similar subspaces.
  In this paper, we propose importance sampling subspace selection (I3S) for low-rank optimization, which theoretically offers a comparable convergence rate to the dominant subspace approach. Empirically, we demonstrate that I3S significantly outperforms previous methods in LLM pretraining tasks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05790,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Devil is in the Details: Density Guidance for Detail-Aware Generation with Flow Models,"arXiv:2502.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, capable of producing high-quality images by mapping noise to a data distribution. However, recent findings suggest that image likelihood does not align with perceptual quality: high-likelihood samples tend to be smooth, while lower-likelihood ones are more detailed. Controlling sample density is thus crucial for balancing realism and detail. In this paper, we analyze an existing technique, Prior Guidance, which scales the latent code to influence image detail. We introduce score alignment, a condition that explains why this method works and show that it can be tractably checked for any continuous normalizing flow model. We then propose Density Guidance, a principled modification of the generative ODE that enables exact log-density control during sampling. Finally, we extend Density Guidance to stochastic sampling, ensuring precise log-density control while allowing controlled variation in structure or fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that these techniques provide fine-grained control over image detail without compromising sample quality.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05807,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
$\mu$nit Scaling: Simple and Scalable FP8 LLM Training,"arXiv:2502.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model training with 8-bit floating point (FP8) formats promises significant efficiency improvements, but reduced numerical precision makes training challenging. It is currently possible to train in FP8 only if one is willing to tune various hyperparameters, reduce model scale, or accept the overhead of computing dynamic scale factors. We demonstrate simple, scalable FP8 training that requires no dynamic scaling factors or special hyperparameters, even at large model sizes. Our method, $\mu$nit Scaling ($\mu$S), also enables simple hyperparameter transfer across model widths, matched numerics across training and inference, and other desirable properties. $\mu$nit Scaling is straightforward to implement, consisting of a set of minimal interventions based on a first-principles analysis of common transformer operations. We validate our method by training models from 1B to 13B parameters, performing all hidden linear layer computations in FP8. We achieve quality equal to higher precision baselines while also training up to 33% faster.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05967,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Scaling Laws for Forgetting during Finetuning with Pretraining Data Injection,"arXiv:2502.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widespread strategy to obtain a language model that performs well on a target domain is to finetune a pretrained model to perform unsupervised next-token prediction on data from that target domain. Finetuning presents two challenges: (i) if the amount of target data is limited, as in most practical applications, the model will quickly overfit, and (ii) the model will drift away from the original model, forgetting the pretraining data and the generic knowledge that comes with it. We aim to derive scaling laws that quantify these two phenomena for various target domains, amounts of available target data, and model scales. We measure the efficiency of injecting pretraining data into the finetuning data mixture to avoid forgetting and mitigate overfitting. A key practical takeaway from our study is that injecting as little as 1% of pretraining data in the finetuning data mixture prevents the model from forgetting the pretraining set.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06042,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Uncertainty-Aware Adaptation of Large Language Models for Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis,"arXiv:2502.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) helps derive cellular mechanistic understanding, particularly in the context of complex conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer.

Beyond Batch Learning: Global Awareness Enhanced Domain Adaptation,"arXiv:2502.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In domain adaptation (DA), the effectiveness of deep learning-based models is often constrained by batch learning strategies that fail to fully apprehend the global statistical and geometric characteristics of data distributions. Addressing this gap, we introduce 'Global Awareness Enhanced Domain Adaptation' (GAN-DA), a novel approach that transcends traditional batch-based limitations. GAN-DA integrates a unique predefined feature representation (PFR) to facilitate the alignment of cross-domain distributions, thereby achieving a comprehensive global statistical awareness. This representation is innovatively expanded to encompass orthogonal and common feature aspects, which enhances the unification of global manifold structures and refines decision boundaries for more effective DA. Our extensive experiments, encompassing 27 diverse cross-domain image classification tasks, demonstrate GAN-DA's remarkable superiority, outperforming 24 established DA methods by a significant margin. Furthermore, our in-depth analyses shed light on the decision-making processes, revealing insights into the adaptability and efficiency of GAN-DA. This approach not only addresses the limitations of existing DA methodologies but also sets a new benchmark in the realm of domain adaptation, offering broad implications for future research and applications in this field.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06272,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
IceBerg: Debiased Self-Training for Class-Imbalanced Node Classification,"arXiv:2502.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in dealing with non-Euclidean graph-structured data and have been widely deployed in many real-world applications. However, their effectiveness is often jeopardized under class-imbalanced training sets. Most existing studies have analyzed class-imbalanced node classification from a supervised learning perspective, but they do not fully utilize the large number of unlabeled nodes in semi-supervised scenarios. We claim that the supervised signal is just the tip of the iceberg and a large number of unlabeled nodes have not yet been effectively utilized. In this work, we propose IceBerg, a debiased self-training framework to address the class-imbalanced and few-shot challenges for GNNs at the same time. Specifically, to figure out the Matthew effect and label distribution shift in self-training, we propose Double Balancing, which can largely improve the performance of existing baselines with just a few lines of code as a simple plug-and-play module. Secondly, to enhance the long-range propagation capability of GNNs, we disentangle the propagation and transformation operations of GNNs. Therefore, the weak supervision signals can propagate more effectively to address the few-shot issue. In summary, we find that leveraging unlabeled nodes can significantly enhance the performance of GNNs in class-imbalanced and few-shot scenarios, and even small, surgical modifications can lead to substantial performance improvements. Systematic experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method can deliver considerable performance gain over existing class-imbalanced node classification baselines.

Utilizing Novelty-based Evolution Strategies to Train Transformers in Reinforcement Learning,"arXiv:2502.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we experiment with novelty-based variants of OpenAI-ES, the NS-ES and NSR-ES algorithms, and evaluate their effectiveness in training complex, transformer-based architectures designed for the problem of reinforcement learning such as Decision Transformers. We also test if we can accelerate the novelty-based training of these larger models by seeding the training by a pretrained models. By this, we build on our previous work, where we tested the ability of evolution strategies - specifically the aforementioned OpenAI-ES - to train the Decision Transformer architecture. The results were mixed. NS-ES showed progress, but it would clearly need many more iterations for it to yield interesting results. NSR-ES, on the other hand, proved quite capable of being straightforwardly used on larger models, since its performance appears as similar between the feed-forward model and Decision Transformer, as it was for the OpenAI-ES in our previous work.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06301,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Analog In-memory Training on General Non-ideal Resistive Elements: The Impact of Response Functions,"arXiv:2502.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the economic and environmental costs of training and deploying large vision or language models increase dramatically, analog in-memory computing (AIMC) emerges as a promising energy-efficient solution. However, the training perspective, especially its training dynamic, is underexplored. In AIMC hardware, the trainable weights are represented by the conductance of resistive elements and updated using consecutive electrical pulses. Among all the physical properties of resistive elements, the response to the pulses directly affects the training dynamics. This paper first provides a theoretical foundation for gradient-based training on AIMC hardware and studies the impact of response functions. We demonstrate that noisy update and asymmetric response functions negatively impact Analog SGD by imposing an implicit penalty term on the objective. To overcome the issue, Tiki-Taka, a residual learning algorithm, converges exactly to a critical point by optimizing a main array and a residual array bilevelly. The conclusion is supported by simulations validating our theoretical insights.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06309,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Calibrating LLMs with Information-Theoretic Evidential Deep Learning,"arXiv:2502.06351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence, particularly when trained on small datasets, resulting in poor calibration and inaccurate uncertainty estimates. Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), an uncertainty-aware approach, enables uncertainty estimation in a single forward pass, making it a promising method for calibrating fine-tuned LLMs. However, despite its computational efficiency, EDL is prone to overfitting, as its training objective can result in overly concentrated probability distributions. To mitigate this, we propose regularizing EDL by incorporating an information bottleneck (IB). Our approach IB-EDL suppresses spurious information in the evidence generated by the model and encourages truly predictive information to influence both the predictions and uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments across various fine-tuned LLMs and tasks demonstrate that IB-EDL outperforms both existing EDL and non-EDL approaches. By improving the trustworthiness of LLMs, IB-EDL facilitates their broader adoption in domains requiring high levels of confidence calibration.

The AI off-switch problem as a signalling game: bounded rationality and incomparability,"arXiv:2502.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The off-switch problem is a critical challenge in AI control: if an AI system resists being switched off, it poses a significant risk. In this paper, we model the off-switch problem as a signalling game, where a human decision-maker communicates its preferences about some underlying decision problem to an AI agent, which then selects actions to maximise the human's utility. We assume that the human is a bounded rational agent and explore various bounded rationality mechanisms. Using real machine learning models, we reprove prior results and demonstrate that a necessary condition for an AI system to refrain from disabling its off-switch is its uncertainty about the human's utility. We also analyse how message costs influence optimal strategies and extend the analysis to scenarios involving incomparability.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06403,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: In laparoscopy surgical training and evaluation, real-time detection of surgical actions with interpretable outputs is crucial for automated and real-time instructional feedback and skill development. Such capability would enable development of machine guided training systems. This paper presents a rapid deployment approach utilizing automated machine learning methods, based on surgical action data collected from both experienced and trainee surgeons. The proposed approach effectively tackles the challenge of highly imbalanced class distributions, ensuring robust predictions across varying skill levels of surgeons. Additionally, our method partially incorporates model transparency, addressing the reliability requirements in medical applications. Compared to deep learning approaches, traditional machine learning models not only facilitate efficient rapid deployment but also offer significant advantages in interpretability.

CS-SHAP: Extending SHAP to Cyclic-Spectral Domain for Better Interpretability of Intelligent Fault Diagnosis,"arXiv:2502.06424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs), with their powerful nonlinear mapping and end-to-end capabilities, are widely applied in mechanical intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD). However, as typical black-box models, they pose challenges in understanding their decision basis and logic, limiting their deployment in high-reliability scenarios. Hence, various methods have been proposed to enhance the interpretability of IFD. Among these, post-hoc approaches can provide explanations without changing model architecture, preserving its flexibility and scalability. However, existing post-hoc methods often suffer from limitations in explanation forms. They either require preprocessing that disrupts the end-to-end nature or overlook fault mechanisms, leading to suboptimal explanations. To address these issues, we derived the cyclic-spectral (CS) transform and proposed the CS-SHAP by extending Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to the CS domain. CS-SHAP can evaluate contributions from both carrier and modulation frequencies, aligning more closely with fault mechanisms and delivering clearer and more accurate explanations. Three datasets are utilized to validate the superior interpretability of CS-SHAP, ensuring its correctness, reproducibility, and practical performance. With open-source code and outstanding interpretability, CS-SHAP has the potential to be widely adopted and become the post-hoc interpretability benchmark in IFD, even in other classification tasks.

MATH-Perturb: Benchmarking LLMs' Math Reasoning Abilities against Hard Perturbations,"arXiv:2502.06453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, which has triggered the discussion of whether the performance is achieved by true reasoning capability or memorization. To investigate this question, prior work has constructed mathematical benchmarks when questions undergo simple perturbations -- modifications that still preserve the underlying reasoning patterns of the solutions. However, no work has explored hard perturbations, which fundamentally change the nature of the problem so that the original solution steps do not apply. To bridge the gap, we construct MATH-P-Simple and MATH-P-Hard via simple perturbation and hard perturbation, respectively. Each consists of 279 perturbed math problems derived from level-5 (hardest) problems in the MATH dataset (Hendrycksmath et. al., 2021). We observe significant performance drops on MATH-P-Hard across various models, including o1-mini (-16.49%) and gemini-2.0-flash-thinking (-12.9%). We also raise concerns about a novel form of memorization where models blindly apply learned problem-solving skills without assessing their applicability to modified contexts. This issue is amplified when using original problems for in-context learning. We call for research efforts to address this challenge, which is critical for developing more robust and reliable reasoning models.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06453,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

EfficientLLM: Scalable Pruning-Aware Pretraining for Architecture-Agnostic Edge Language Models,"arXiv:2502.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) driven by scaling laws, achieve intelligence emergency in large model sizes. Recently, the increasing concerns about cloud costs, latency, and privacy make it an urgent requirement to develop compact edge language models. Distinguished from direct pretraining that bounded by the scaling law, this work proposes the pruning-aware pretraining, focusing on retaining performance of much larger optimized models. It features following characteristics: 1) Data-scalable: we introduce minimal parameter groups in LLM and continuously optimize structural pruning, extending post-training pruning methods like LLM-Pruner and SparseGPT into the pretraining phase. 2) Architecture-agnostic: the LLM architecture is auto-designed using saliency-driven pruning, which is the first time to exceed SoTA human-designed LLMs in modern pretraining. We reveal that it achieves top-quality edge language models, termed EfficientLLM, by scaling up LLM compression and extending its boundary. EfficientLLM significantly outperforms SoTA baselines with $100M \sim 1B$ parameters, such as MobileLLM, SmolLM, Qwen2.5-0.5B, OLMo-1B, Llama3.2-1B in common sense benchmarks. As the first attempt, EfficientLLM bridges the performance gap between traditional LLM compression and direct pretraining methods, and we will fully open source at https://github.com/Xingrun-Xing2/EfficientLLM.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06663,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
"No Trick, No Treat: Pursuits and Challenges Towards Simulation-free Training of Neural Samplers","arXiv:2502.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the sampling problem, where the aim is to draw samples from a distribution whose density is known only up to a normalization constant. Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling to approximate a high-dimensional data distribution have sparked significant interest in developing neural network-based methods for this challenging problem. However, neural samplers typically incur heavy computational overhead due to simulating trajectories during training. This motivates the pursuit of simulation-free training procedures of neural samplers. In this work, we propose an elegant modification to previous methods, which allows simulation-free training with the help of a time-dependent normalizing flow. However, it ultimately suffers from severe mode collapse. On closer inspection, we find that nearly all successful neural samplers rely on Langevin preconditioning to avoid mode collapsing. We systematically analyze several popular methods with various objective functions and demonstrate that, in the absence of Langevin preconditioning, most of them fail to adequately cover even a simple target. Finally, we draw attention to a strong baseline by combining the state-of-the-art MCMC method, Parallel Tempering (PT), with an additional generative model to shed light on future explorations of neural samplers.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06685,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

FairDropout: Using Example-Tied Dropout to Enhance Generalization of Minority Groups,"arXiv:2502.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models frequently exploit spurious features in training data to achieve low training error, often resulting in poor generalization when faced with shifted testing distributions. To address this issue, various methods from imbalanced learning, representation learning, and classifier recalibration have been proposed to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks against spurious correlations. In this paper, we observe that models trained with empirical risk minimization tend to generalize well for examples from the majority groups while memorizing instances from minority groups. Building on recent findings that show memorization can be localized to a limited number of neurons, we apply example-tied dropout as a method we term FairDropout, aimed at redirecting this memorization to specific neurons that we subsequently drop out during inference. We empirically evaluate FairDropout using the subpopulation benchmark suite encompassing vision, language, and healthcare tasks, demonstrating that it significantly reduces reliance on spurious correlations, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06695,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
FlexDeMo: Decoupled Momentum Optimization for Fully and Hybrid Sharded Training,"arXiv:2502.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large neural network models requires extensive computational resources, often distributed across several nodes and accelerators. Recent findings suggest that it may be sufficient to only exchange the fast moving components of the gradients, while accumulating momentum locally (Decoupled Momentum, or DeMo). However, when considering larger models that do not fit on a single accelerate, the exchange of gradient information and the integration of DeMo needs to be reconsidered. Here, we propose employing a hybrid strategy, FlexDeMo, whereby nodes fully synchronize locally between different GPUs and inter-node communication is improved through only using the fast-moving components. This effectively combines previous hybrid sharding strategies with the advantages of decoupled momentum. Our experimental results show that FlexDeMo is on par with AdamW in terms of validation loss, demonstrating its viability.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06728,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Dynamic Loss-Based Sample Reweighting for Improved Large Language Model Pretraining,"arXiv:2502.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on vast and heterogeneous datasets is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks. However, current training paradigms treat all samples equally, overlooking the importance or relevance of individual samples throughout the training process. Existing reweighting strategies, which primarily focus on group-level data importance, fail to leverage fine-grained instance-level information and do not adapt dynamically to individual sample importance as training progresses. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithms for dynamic, instance-level data reweighting aimed at improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining. Our methods adjust the weight of each training sample based on its loss value in an online fashion, allowing the model to dynamically focus on more informative or important samples at the current training stage. In particular, our framework allows us to systematically devise reweighting strategies deprioritizing redundant or uninformative data, which we find tend to work best. Furthermore, we develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of loss-based reweighting on the convergence of gradient-based optimization, providing the first formal characterization of how these strategies affect convergence bounds. We empirically validate our approach across a spectrum of tasks, from pretraining 7B and 1.4B parameter LLMs to smaller-scale language models and linear regression problems, demonstrating that our loss-based reweighting approach can lead to faster convergence and significantly improved performance.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06733,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
VersaPRM: Multi-Domain Process Reward Model via Synthetic Reasoning Data,"arXiv:2502.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have proven effective at enhancing mathematical reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging increased inference-time computation. However, they are predominantly trained on mathematical data and their generalizability to non-mathematical domains has not been rigorously studied. In response, this work first shows that current PRMs have poor performance in other domains. To address this limitation, we introduce VersaPRM, a multi-domain PRM trained on synthetic reasoning data generated using our novel data generation and annotation method. VersaPRM achieves consistent performance gains across diverse domains. For instance, in the MMLU-Pro category of Law, VersaPRM via weighted majority voting, achieves a 7.9% performance gain over the majority voting baseline -- surpassing Qwen2.5-Math-PRM's gain of 1.3%.

Gradient Multi-Normalization for Stateless and Scalable LLM Training,"arXiv:2502.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers like Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) which store additional state information to accelerate convergence but incur significant memory overhead. Recent efforts, such as SWAN (Ma et al., 2024) address this by eliminating the need for optimizer states while achieving performance comparable to Adam via a multi-step preprocessing procedure applied to instantaneous gradients. Motivated by the success of SWAN, we introduce a novel framework for designing stateless optimizers that normalizes stochastic gradients according to multiple norms. To achieve this, we propose a simple alternating scheme to enforce the normalization of gradients w.r.t these norms. We show that our procedure can produce, up to an arbitrary precision, a fixed-point of the problem, and that SWAN is a particular instance of our approach with carefully chosen norms, providing a deeper understanding of its design. However, SWAN's computationally expensive whitening/orthogonalization step limit its practicality for large LMs. Using our principled perspective, we develop of a more efficient, scalable, and practical stateless optimizer. Our algorithm relaxes the properties of SWAN, significantly reducing its computational cost while retaining its memory efficiency, making it applicable to training large-scale models. Experiments on pre-training LLaMA models with up to 1 billion parameters demonstrate a 3X speedup over Adam with significantly reduced memory requirements, outperforming other memory-efficient baselines.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06742,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
"Train for the Worst, Plan for the Best: Understanding Token Ordering in Masked Diffusions","arXiv:2502.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative approach for generative modeling over discrete domains. Compared to autoregressive models (ARMs), MDMs trade off complexity at training time with flexibility at inference time. At training time, they must learn to solve an exponentially large number of infilling problems, but at inference time, they can decode tokens in essentially arbitrary order. In this work, we closely examine these two competing effects. On the training front, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that MDMs indeed train on computationally intractable subproblems compared to their autoregressive counterparts. On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from $<7$% to $\approx 90$%, even outperforming ARMs with $7\times$ as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06768,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: Ensuring neural networks adhere to domain-specific constraints is crucial for addressing safety and ethical concerns while also enhancing prediction accuracy. Despite the nonlinear nature of most real-world tasks, existing methods are predominantly limited to affine or convex constraints. We introduce ENFORCE, a neural network architecture that guarantees predictions to satisfy nonlinear constraints exactly. ENFORCE is trained with standard unconstrained gradient-based optimizers (e.g., Adam) and leverages autodifferentiation and local neural projections to enforce any $\mathcal{C}^1$ constraint to arbitrary tolerance $\epsilon$. We build an adaptive-depth neural projection (AdaNP) module that dynamically adjusts its complexity to suit the specific problem and the required tolerance levels. ENFORCE guarantees satisfaction of equality constraints that are nonlinear in both inputs and outputs of the neural network with minimal (and adjustable) computational cost.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06774,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: The trade-off between accuracy and interpretability has long been a challenge in machine learning (ML). This tension is particularly significant for emerging interpretable-by-design methods, which aim to redesign ML algorithms for trustworthy interpretability but often sacrifice accuracy in the process. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating the impact of deviations in concept representations-an essential component of interpretable models-on prediction performance and propose a novel framework to mitigate these effects. The framework builds on the principle of optimizing concept embeddings under constraints that preserve interpretability. Using a generative model as a test-bed, we rigorously prove that our algorithm achieves zero loss while progressively enhancing the interpretability of the resulting model. Additionally, we evaluate the practical performance of our proposed framework in generating explainable predictions for image classification tasks across various benchmarks. Compared to existing explainable methods, our approach not only improves prediction accuracy while preserving model interpretability across various large-scale benchmarks but also achieves this with significantly lower computational cost.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06775,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: The predominant approach for training web navigation agents gathers human demonstrations for a set of popular websites and hand-written tasks, but it is becoming clear that human data are an inefficient resource. We develop a pipeline to facilitate Internet-scale training for agents without laborious human annotations. In the first stage, an LLM generates tasks for 150k diverse websites. In the next stage, LLM agents complete tasks and produce trajectories. In the final stage, an LLM reviews the trajectories and judges their success. Language models are competitive with human annotators, detecting and filtering out harmful content with an accuracy of 97%, generating feasible tasks with an 89% rate, and judging successful trajectories with an 82.6% accuracy. Scaling the pipeline, agents based on Llama 3.1 70B solve 16.7% of tasks for 150k sites. Training on the data generated by our pipeline is competitive with training on human demonstrations.

RelGNN: Composite Message Passing for Relational Deep Learning,"arXiv:2502.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive tasks on relational databases are critical in real-world applications spanning e-commerce, healthcare, and social media. To address these tasks effectively, Relational Deep Learning (RDL) encodes relational data as graphs, enabling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to exploit relational structures for improved predictions. However, existing heterogeneous GNNs often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of relational databases, leading to modeling inefficiencies. Here we introduce RelGNN, a novel GNN framework specifically designed to capture the unique characteristics of relational databases. At the core of our approach is the introduction of atomic routes, which are sequences of nodes forming high-order tripartite structures. Building upon these atomic routes, RelGNN designs new composite message passing mechanisms between heterogeneous nodes, allowing direct single-hop interactions between them. This approach avoids redundant aggregations and mitigates information entanglement, ultimately leading to more efficient and accurate predictive modeling.

Scalable Oversight for Superhuman AI via Recursive Self-Critiquing,"arXiv:2502.04675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI capabilities increasingly surpass human proficiency in complex tasks, current alignment techniques including SFT and RLHF face fundamental challenges in ensuring reliable oversight. These methods rely on direct human assessment and become untenable when AI outputs exceed human cognitive thresholds. In response to this challenge, we explore two hypotheses: (1) critique of critique can be easier than critique itself, extending the widely-accepted observation that verification is easier than generation to the critique domain, as critique itself is a specialized form of generation; (2) this difficulty relationship is recursively held, suggesting that when direct evaluation is infeasible, performing high-order critiques (e.g., critique of critique of critique) offers a more tractable supervision pathway. To examine these hypotheses, we perform Human-Human, Human-AI, and AI-AI experiments across multiple tasks. Our results demonstrate encouraging evidence supporting these hypotheses and suggest that recursive self-critiquing is a promising direction for scalable oversight.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04675,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

An Adaptable Budget Planner for Enhancing Budget-Constrained Auto-Bidding in Online Advertising,"arXiv:2502.05187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In online advertising, advertisers commonly utilize auto-bidding services to bid for impression opportunities. A typical objective of the auto-bidder is to optimize the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions within specified budget constraints. However, such a problem is challenging due to the complex bidding environment faced by diverse advertisers. To address this challenge, we introduce ABPlanner, a few-shot adaptable budget planner designed to improve budget-constrained auto-bidding. ABPlanner is based on a hierarchical bidding framework that decomposes the bidding process into shorter, manageable stages. Within this framework, ABPlanner allocates the budget across all stages, allowing a low-level auto-bidder to bids based on the budget allocation plan. The adaptability of ABPlanner is achieved through a sequential decision-making approach, inspired by in-context reinforcement learning. For each advertiser, ABPlanner adjusts the budget allocation plan episode by episode, using data from previous episodes as prompt for current decisions. This enables ABPlanner to quickly adapt to different advertisers with few-shot data, providing a sample-efficient solution. Extensive simulation experiments and real-world A/B testing validate the effectiveness of ABPlanner, demonstrating its capability to enhance the cumulative value achieved by auto-bidders.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05187,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Physics-Driven Self-Supervised Deep Learning for Free-Surface Multiple Elimination,"arXiv:2502.05189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising alternative approach for various seismic processing tasks, including primary estimation (or multiple elimination), a crucial step for accurate subsurface imaging. In geophysics, DL methods are commonly based on supervised learning from large amounts of high-quality labelled data. Instead of relying on traditional supervised learning, in the context of free-surface multiple elimination, we propose a method in which the DL model learns to effectively parameterize the free-surface multiple-free wavefield from the full wavefield by incorporating the underlying physics into the loss computation. This, in turn, yields high-quality estimates without ever being shown any ground truth data. Currently, the network reparameterization is performed independently for each dataset. We demonstrate its effectiveness through tests on both synthetic and field data. We employ industry-standard Surface-Related Multiple Elimination (SRME) using, respectively, global least-squares adaptive subtraction and local least-squares adaptive subtraction as benchmarks. The comparison shows that the proposed method outperforms the benchmarks in estimation accuracy, achieving the most complete primary estimation and the least multiple energy leakage, but at the cost of a higher computational burden.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05189,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Physics-Trained Neural Network as Inverse Problem Solver for Potential Fields: An Example of Downward Continuation between Arbitrary Surfaces,"arXiv:2502.05190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Downward continuation is a critical task in potential field processing, including gravity and magnetic fields, which aims to transfer data from one observation surface to another that is closer to the source of the field. Its effectiveness directly impacts the success of detecting and highlighting subsurface anomalous sources. We treat downward continuation as an inverse problem that relies on solving a forward problem defined by the formula for upward continuation, and we propose a new physics-trained deep neural network (DNN)-based solution for this task. We hard-code the upward continuation process into the DNN's learning framework, where the DNN itself learns to act as the inverse problem solver and can perform downward continuation without ever being shown any ground truth data. We test the proposed method on both synthetic magnetic data and real-world magnetic data from West Antarctica. The preliminary results demonstrate its effectiveness through comparison with selected benchmarks, opening future avenues for the combined use of DNNs and established geophysical theories to address broader potential field inverse problems, such as density and geometry modelling.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05190,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
A finite element-based machine learning model for hydro-mechanical analysis of swelling behavior in clay-sulfate rocks,"arXiv:2502.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydro-mechanical behavior of clay-sulfate rocks, especially their swelling properties, poses significant challenges in geotechnical engineering. This study presents a hybrid constrained machine learning (ML) model developed using the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) tuned with a Bayesian optimization algorithm to predict and analyze the swelling behavior of these complex geological materials. Initially, a coupled hydro-mechanical model based on the Richards' equation coupled to a deformation process with linear kinematics implemented within the finite element framework OpenGeoSys was used to simulate the observed ground heave in Staufen, Germany, caused by water inflow into the clay-sulfate bearing Triassic Grabfeld Formation. A systematic parametric analysis using Gaussian distributions of key parameters, including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, maximum swelling pressure, permeability, and air entry pressure, was performed to construct a synthetic database. The ML model takes time, spatial coordinates, and these parameter values as inputs, while water saturation, porosity, and vertical displacement are outputs. In addition, penalty terms were incorporated into the CatBoost objective function to enforce physically meaningful predictions. Results show that the hybrid approach effectively captures the nonlinear and dynamic interactions that govern hydro-mechanical processes. The study demonstrates the ability of the model to predict the swelling behavior of clay-sulfate rocks, providing a robust tool for risk assessment and management in affected regions. The results highlight the potential of ML-driven models to address complex geotechnical challenges.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05198,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Watermarking across Modalities for Content Tracing and Generative AI,"arXiv:2502.05215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watermarking embeds information into digital content like images, audio, or text, imperceptible to humans but robustly detectable by specific algorithms. This technology has important applications in many challenges of the industry such as content moderation, tracing AI-generated content, and monitoring the usage of AI models. The contributions of this thesis include the development of new watermarking techniques for images, audio, and text. We first introduce methods for active moderation of images on social platforms. We then develop specific techniques for AI-generated content. We specifically demonstrate methods to adapt latent generative models to embed watermarks in all generated content, identify watermarked sections in speech, and improve watermarking in large language models with tests that ensure low false positive rates. Furthermore, we explore the use of digital watermarking to detect model misuse, including the detection of watermarks in language models fine-tuned on watermarked text, and introduce training-free watermarks for the weights of large transformers. Through these contributions, the thesis provides effective solutions for the challenges posed by the increasing use of generative AI models and the need for model monitoring and content moderation. It finally examines the challenges and limitations of watermarking techniques and discuss potential future directions for research in this area.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05215,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
KDA: A Knowledge-Distilled Attacker for Generating Diverse Prompts to Jailbreak LLMs,"arXiv:2502.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks exploit specific prompts to bypass LLM safeguards, causing the LLM to generate harmful, inappropriate, and misaligned content. Current jailbreaking methods rely heavily on carefully designed system prompts and numerous queries to achieve a single successful attack, which is costly and impractical for large-scale red-teaming. To address this challenge, we propose to distill the knowledge of an ensemble of SOTA attackers into a single open-source model, called Knowledge-Distilled Attacker (KDA), which is finetuned to automatically generate coherent and diverse attack prompts without the need for meticulous system prompt engineering. Compared to existing attackers, KDA achieves higher attack success rates and greater cost-time efficiency when targeting multiple SOTA open-source and commercial black-box LLMs. Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative diversity analysis of prompts generated by baseline methods and KDA, identifying diverse and ensemble attacks as key factors behind KDA's effectiveness and efficiency.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05223,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
SEER: Self-Explainability Enhancement of Large Language Models' Representations,"arXiv:2502.05242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the hidden representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a perspective to understand LLMs' underlying inference logic and improve their reliability in application scenarios. However, previous methods introduce external ''black-box'' modules to explain ''black-box'' LLMs, increasing the potential uncertainty and failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose a self-explaining method SEER, enhancing LLMs' explainability by aggregating the same concept and disentangling the different concepts in the representation space. In this way, SEER provides faithful explanations carried by representations synchronously with the LLMs' output. Additionally, we showcase the applications of SEER on trustworthiness-related tasks (e.g., the safety risks classification and detoxification tasks), where self-explained LLMs achieve consistent improvement in explainability and performance. More crucially, we theoretically analyze the improvement of SEER on LLMs' generalization ability through optimal transport theory.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05242,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Quantum automated learning with provable and explainable trainability,"arXiv:2502.05264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is widely believed to be one of the most promising practical applications of quantum computing. Existing quantum machine learning schemes typically employ a quantum-classical hybrid approach that relies crucially on gradients of model parameters. Such an approach lacks provable convergence to global minima and will become infeasible as quantum learning models scale up. Here, we introduce quantum automated learning, where no variational parameter is involved and the training process is converted to quantum state preparation. In particular, we encode training data into unitary operations and iteratively evolve a random initial state under these unitaries and their inverses, with a target-oriented perturbation towards higher prediction accuracy sandwiched in between. Under reasonable assumptions, we rigorously prove that the evolution converges exponentially to the desired state corresponding to the global minimum of the loss function. We show that such a training process can be understood from the perspective of preparing quantum states by imaginary time evolution, where the data-encoded unitaries together with target-oriented perturbations would train the quantum learning model in an automated fashion. We further prove that the quantum automated learning paradigm features good generalization ability with the generalization error upper bounded by the ratio between a logarithmic function of the Hilbert space dimension and the number of training samples. In addition, we carry out extensive numerical simulations on real-life images and quantum data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the assumptions. Our results establish an unconventional quantum learning strategy that is gradient-free with provable and explainable trainability, which would be crucial for large-scale practical applications of quantum computing in machine learning scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05264,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
A Tutorial On Intersectionality in Fair Rankings,"arXiv:2502.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the critical issue of biased algorithms and unfair rankings, which have permeated various sectors, including search engines, recommendation systems, and workforce management. These biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes in a data-driven world, especially against marginalized and underrepresented groups. Efforts towards responsible data science and responsible artificial intelligence aim to mitigate these biases and promote fairness, diversity, and transparency. However, most fairness-aware ranking methods singularly focus on protected attributes such as race, gender, or socio-economic status, neglecting the intersectionality of these attributes, i.e., the interplay between multiple social identities. Understanding intersectionality is crucial to ensure that existing inequalities are not preserved by fair rankings. We offer a description of the main ways to incorporate intersectionality in fair ranking systems through practical examples and provide a comparative overview of existing literature and a synoptic table summarizing the various methodologies. Our analysis highlights the need for intersectionality to attain fairness, while also emphasizing that fairness, alone, does not necessarily imply intersectionality.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05333,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Agentic AI Systems Applied to tasks in Financial Services: Modeling and model risk management crews,"arXiv:2502.05439v1 Announce Type: cross

Online Bidding Algorithms with Strict Return on Spend (ROS) Constraint,"arXiv:2502.05599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auto-bidding problem under a strict return-on-spend constraint (ROSC) is considered, where an algorithm has to make decisions about how much to bid for an ad slot depending on the revealed value, and the hidden allocation and payment function that describes the probability of winning the ad-slot depending on its bid. The objective of an algorithm is to maximize the expected utility (product of ad value and probability of winning the ad slot) summed across all time slots subject to the total expected payment being less than the total expected utility, called the ROSC. A (surprising) impossibility result is derived that shows that no online algorithm can achieve a sub-linear regret even when the value, allocation and payment function are drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The problem is non-trivial even when the revealed value remains constant across time slots, and an algorithm with regret guarantee that is optimal up to logarithmic factor is derived.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05599,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Using agent-based models and EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to simulate social behaviors and policy intervention scenarios: A case study of private well users in Ireland,"arXiv:2502.05718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around 50 percent of Irelands rural population relies on unregulated private wells vulnerable to agricultural runoff and untreated wastewater. High national rates of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and other waterborne illnesses have been linked to well water exposure. Periodic well testing is essential for public health, yet the lack of government incentives places the financial burden on households. Understanding environmental, cognitive, and material factors influencing well-testing behavior is critical.
  This study employs Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to simulate policy interventions based on national survey data. The ABM framework, designed for private well-testing behavior, integrates a Deep Q-network reinforcement learning model and Explainable AI (XAI) for decision-making insights. Key features were selected using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with 10-fold cross-validation, while SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) provided further interpretability for policy recommendations.
  Fourteen policy scenarios were tested. The most effective, Free Well Testing plus Communication Campaign, increased participation to 435 out of 561 agents, from a baseline of approximately 5 percent, with rapid behavioral adaptation. Free Well Testing plus Regulation also performed well, with 433 out of 561 agents initiating well testing. Free testing alone raised participation to over 75 percent, with some agents testing multiple times annually. Scenarios with free well testing achieved faster learning efficiency, converging in 1000 episodes, while others took 2000 episodes, indicating slower adaptation.
  This research demonstrates the value of ABM and XAI in public health policy, providing a framework for evaluating behavioral interventions in environmental health.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05718,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Dynamic Pricing in the Linear Valuation Model using Shape Constraints,"arXiv:2502.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a shape-constrained approach to dynamic pricing for censored data in the linear valuation model that eliminates the need for tuning parameters commonly required in existing methods. Previous works have addressed the challenge of unknown market noise distribution F using strategies ranging from kernel methods to reinforcement learning algorithms, such as bandit techniques and upper confidence bounds (UCB), under the Lipschitz (and stronger) assumption(s) on $F_0$. In contrast, our method relies on isotonic regression under the weaker assumption that $F_0$ is $\alpha$-Holder continuous for some $\alpha \in (0,1]$. We obtain an upper bound on the asymptotic expected regret that matches existing bounds in the literature for $\alpha = 1$ (the Lipschitz case). Simulations and experiments with real-world data obtained by Welltower Inc (a major healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust) consistently demonstrate that our method attains better empirical regret in comparison to several existing methods in the literature while offering the advantage of being completely tuning-parameter free.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05776,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Image-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network Models,"arXiv:2502.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is an untreatable, progressive brain disorder that slowly robs people of their memory, thinking abilities, and ultimately their capacity to complete even the most basic tasks. Among older adults, it is the most frequent cause of dementia. Although there is presently no treatment for Alzheimer's disease, scientific trials are ongoing to discover drugs to combat the condition. Treatments to slow the signs of dementia are also available. Many researchers throughout the world became interested in developing computer-aided diagnosis systems to aid in the early identification of this deadly disease and assure an accurate diagnosis. In particular, image based approaches have been coupled with machine learning techniques to address the challenges of Alzheimer's disease detection. This study proposes a computer aided diagnosis system to detect Alzheimer's disease from biomarkers captured using neuroimaging techniques. The proposed approach relies on deep learning techniques to extract the relevant visual features from the image collection to accurately predict the Alzheimer's class value. In the experiments, standard datasets and pre-trained deep learning models were investigated. Moreover, standard performance measures were used to assess the models' performances. The obtained results proved that VGG16-based models outperform the state of the art performance.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05815,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
MetaML-Pro: Cross-Stage Design Flow Automation for Efficient Deep Learning Acceleration,"arXiv:2502.05850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for codifying and automating optimization strategies to efficiently deploy deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained hardware, such as FPGAs, while maintaining high performance, accuracy, and resource efficiency. Deploying DNNs on such platforms involves addressing the significant challenge of balancing performance, resource usage (e.g., DSPs and LUTs), and inference accuracy, which often requires extensive manual effort and domain expertise. Our novel approach addresses two key issues: cross-stage co-optimization and optimization search. By seamlessly integrating programmatic DNN optimization techniques with high-level synthesis (HLS)-based metaprogramming and leveraging advanced design space exploration (DSE) strategies like Bayesian optimization, the framework automates both top-down and bottom-up design flows, reducing the need for manual intervention and domain expertise. The proposed framework introduces customizable optimization, transformation, and control blocks to enhance DNN accelerator performance and resource efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 92\% DSP and 89\% LUT usage reduction for select networks, while preserving accuracy, along with a 15.6-fold reduction in optimization time compared to grid search. These results underscore the novelty and potential of the proposed framework for automated, resource-efficient DNN accelerator designs.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05850,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Barriers and Pathways to Human-AI Alignment: A Game-Theoretic Approach,"arXiv:2502.05934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under what conditions can capable AI agents efficiently align their actions with human preferences? More specifically, when they are proficient enough to collaborate with us, how long does coordination take, and when is it computationally feasible? These foundational questions of AI alignment help define what makes an AI agent ``sufficiently safe'' and valuable to humans. Since such generally capable systems do not yet exist, a theoretical analysis is needed to establish when guarantees hold -- and what they even are.
  We introduce a game-theoretic framework that generalizes prior alignment approaches with fewer assumptions, allowing us to analyze the computational complexity of alignment across $M$ objectives and $N$ agents, providing both upper and lower bounds. Unlike previous work, which often assumes common priors, idealized communication, or implicit tractability, our framework formally characterizes the difficulty of alignment under minimal assumptions.
  Our main result shows that even when agents are fully rational and computationally \emph{unbounded}, alignment can be achieved with high probability in time \emph{linear} in the task space size. Therefore, in real-world settings, where task spaces are often \emph{exponential} in input length, this remains impractical. More strikingly, our lower bound demonstrates that alignment is \emph{impossible} to speed up when scaling to exponentially many tasks or agents, highlighting a fundamental computational barrier to scalable alignment.
  Relaxing these idealized assumptions, we study \emph{computationally bounded} agents with noisy messages (representing obfuscated intent), showing that while alignment can still succeed with high probability, it incurs additional \emph{exponential} slowdowns in the task space size, number of agents, and number of tasks.
  We conclude by identifying conditions that make alignment more feasible.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05934,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Detection of Physiological Data Tampering Attacks with Quantum Machine Learning,"arXiv:2502.05966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of cloud-based medical devices and wearable sensors has made physiological data susceptible to tampering. These attacks can compromise the reliability of healthcare systems which can be critical and life-threatening. Detection of such data tampering is of immediate need. Machine learning has been used to detect anomalies in datasets but the performance of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is still yet to be evaluated for physiological sensor data. Thus, our study compares the effectiveness of QML for detecting physiological data tampering, focusing on two types of white-box attacks: data poisoning and adversarial perturbation. The results show that QML models are better at identifying label-flipping attacks, achieving accuracy rates of 75%-95% depending on the data and attack severity. This superior performance is due to the ability of quantum algorithms to handle complex and high-dimensional data. However, both QML and classical models struggle to detect more sophisticated adversarial perturbation attacks, which subtly alter data without changing its statistical properties. Although QML performed poorly against this attack with around 45%-65% accuracy, it still outperformed classical algorithms in some cases.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05966,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Uncertainty Quantification and Causal Considerations for Off-Policy Decision Making,"arXiv:2502.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a critical challenge in robust decision-making that seeks to assess the performance of a new policy using data collected under a different policy. However, the existing OPE methodologies suffer from several limitations arising from statistical uncertainty as well as causal considerations. In this thesis, we address these limitations by presenting three different works. Firstly, we consider the problem of high variance in the importance-sampling-based OPE estimators. We introduce the Marginal Ratio (MR) estimator, a novel OPE method that reduces variance by focusing on the marginal distribution of outcomes rather than direct policy shifts, improving robustness in contextual bandits. Next, we propose Conformal Off-Policy Prediction (COPP), a principled approach for uncertainty quantification in OPE that provides finite-sample predictive intervals, ensuring robust decision-making in risk-sensitive applications. Finally, we address causal unidentifiability in off-policy decision-making by developing novel bounds for sequential decision settings, which remain valid under arbitrary unmeasured confounding. We apply these bounds to assess the reliability of digital twin models, introducing a falsification framework to identify scenarios where model predictions diverge from real-world behaviour. Our contributions provide new insights into robust decision-making under uncertainty and establish principled methods for evaluating policies in both static and dynamic settings.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06011,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Training Language Models for Social Deduction with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"arXiv:2502.06060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communicating in natural language is a powerful tool in multi-agent settings, as it enables independent agents to share information in partially observable settings and allows zero-shot coordination with humans. However, most prior works are limited as they either rely on training with large amounts of human demonstrations or lack the ability to generate natural and useful communication strategies. In this work, we train language models to have productive discussions about their environment in natural language without any human demonstrations. We decompose the communication problem into listening and speaking. Our key idea is to leverage the agent's goal to predict useful information about the world as a dense reward signal that guides communication. Specifically, we improve a model's listening skills by training them to predict information about the environment based on discussions, and we simultaneously improve a model's speaking skills with multi-agent reinforcement learning by rewarding messages based on their influence on other agents. To investigate the role and necessity of communication in complex social settings, we study an embodied social deduction game based on Among Us, where the key question to answer is the identity of an adversarial imposter. We analyze emergent behaviors due to our technique, such as accusing suspects and providing evidence, and find that it enables strong discussions, doubling the win rates compared to standard RL.

To address this, we propose a Riemannian optimization approach that dynamically adapts spectral-factorized positive-definite curvature estimates, enabling the efficient application of arbitrary matrix roots and generic curvature learning. We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our approach in positive-definite matrix optimization and covariance adaptation for gradient-free optimization, as well as its efficiency in curvature learning for neural net training.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06268,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Automatic Identification of Samples in Hip-Hop Music via Multi-Loss Training and an Artificial Dataset,"arXiv:2502.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling, the practice of reusing recorded music or sounds from another source in a new work, is common in popular music genres like hip-hop and rap. Numerous services have emerged that allow users to identify connections between samples and the songs that incorporate them, with the goal of enhancing music discovery. Designing a system that can perform the same task automatically is challenging, as samples are commonly altered with audio effects like pitch- and time-stretching and may only be seconds long. Progress on this task has been minimal and is further blocked by the limited availability of training data. Here, we show that a convolutional neural network trained on an artificial dataset can identify real-world samples in commercial hip-hop music. We extract vocal, harmonic, and percussive elements from several databases of non-commercial music recordings using audio source separation, and train the model to fingerprint a subset of these elements in transformed versions of the original audio. We optimize the model using a joint classification and metric learning loss and show that it achieves 13% greater precision on real-world instances of sampling than a fingerprinting system using acoustic landmarks, and that it can recognize samples that have been both pitch shifted and time stretched. We also show that, for half of the commercial music recordings we tested, our model is capable of locating the position of a sample to within five seconds.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06364,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: Context. As software systems become more integrated into society's infrastructure, the responsibility of software professionals to ensure compliance with various non-functional requirements increases. These requirements include security, safety, privacy, and, increasingly, non-discrimination.
  Motivation. Fairness in pricing algorithms grants equitable access to basic services without discriminating on the basis of protected attributes.
  Method. We replicate a previous empirical study that used black box testing to audit pricing algorithms used by Italian car insurance companies, accessible through a popular online system. With respect to the previous study, we enlarged the number of tests and the number of demographic variables under analysis.
  Results. Our work confirms and extends previous findings, highlighting the problematic permanence of discrimination across time: demographic variables significantly impact pricing to this day, with birthplace remaining the main discriminatory factor against individuals not born in Italian cities. We also found that driver profiles can determine the number of quotes available to the user, denying equal opportunities to all.
  Conclusion. The study underscores the importance of testing for non-discrimination in software systems that affect people's everyday lives.

Abstract: The emergence of the fifth generation (5G) technology has transformed mobile networks into multi-service environments, necessitating efficient network slicing to meet diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs). SLA decomposition across multiple network domains, each potentially managed by different service providers, poses a significant challenge due to limited visibility into real-time underlying domain conditions. This paper introduces Risk-Aware Iterated Local Search (RAILS), a novel risk model-driven meta-heuristic framework designed to jointly address SLA decomposition and service provider selection in multi-domain networks. By integrating online risk modeling with iterated local search principles, RAILS effectively navigates the complex optimization landscape, utilizing historical feedback from domain controllers.

Incentivizing Desirable Effort Profiles in Strategic Classification: The Role of Causality and Uncertainty,"arXiv:2502.06749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study strategic classification in binary decision-making settings where agents can modify their features in order to improve their classification outcomes. Importantly, our work considers the causal structure across different features, acknowledging that effort in a given feature may affect other features. The main goal of our work is to understand \emph{when and how much agent effort is invested towards desirable features}, and how this is influenced by the deployed classifier, the causal structure of the agent's features, their ability to modify them, and the information available to the agent about the classifier and the feature causal graph.
  In the complete information case, when agents know the classifier and the causal structure of the problem, we derive conditions ensuring that rational agents focus on features favored by the principal. We show that designing classifiers to induce desirable behavior is generally non-convex, though tractable in special cases. We also extend our analysis to settings where agents have incomplete information about the classifier or the causal graph. While optimal effort selection is again a non-convex problem under general uncertainty, we highlight special cases of partial uncertainty where this selection problem becomes tractable. Our results indicate that uncertainty drives agents to favor features with higher expected importance and lower variance, potentially misaligning with principal preferences.

Abstract: Surrogate models are widely used in natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning to approximate complex systems and reduce computational costs. However, the current landscape lacks standardisation across key stages of the pipeline, including data collection, sampling design, model class selection, evaluation metrics, and downstream task performance analysis. This fragmentation limits reproducibility, reliability, and cross-domain applicability. The issue has only been exacerbated by the AI revolution and a new suite of surrogate model classes that it offers. In this position paper, we argue for the urgent need for a unified framework to guide the development and evaluation of surrogate models. We outline essential steps for constructing a comprehensive pipeline and discuss alternative perspectives, such as the benefits of domain-specific frameworks. By advocating for a standardised approach, this paper seeks to improve the reliability of surrogate modelling, foster cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer, and, as a result, accelerate scientific progress.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06753,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Differential Parity: Relative Fairness Between Two Sets of Decisions,"arXiv:2112.11279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With AI systems widely applied to assist human in decision-making processes such as talent hiring, school admission, and loan approval; there is an increasing need to ensure that the decisions made are fair. One major challenge for analyzing fairness in decisions is that the standards are highly subjective and contextual -- there is no consensus for what absolute fairness means for every scenario. Not to say that different fairness standards often conflict with each other. To bypass this issue, this work aims to test relative fairness in decisions. That is, instead of defining what are ``absolutely'' fair decisions, we propose to test the relative fairness of one decision set against another with differential parity -- the difference between two sets of decisions should be independent from a certain sensitive attribute. This proposed differential parity fairness notion has the following benefits: (1) it avoids the ambiguous and contradictory definition of ``absolutely'' fair decisions; (2) it reveals the relative preference and bias between two decision sets; (3) differential parity can serve as a new group fairness notion when a reference set of decisions (ground truths) is provided. One limitation for differential parity is that, it requires the two sets of decisions under comparison to be made on the same data subjects. To overcome this limitation, we propose to utilize a machine learning model to bridge the gap between the two decisions sets made on difference data and estimate the differential parity.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11279,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Trainable Weight Averaging: Accelerating Training and Improving Generalization,"arXiv:2205.13104v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weight averaging is a widely used technique for accelerating training and improving the generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs). While existing approaches like stochastic weight averaging (SWA) rely on pre-set weighting schemes, they can be suboptimal when handling diverse weights. We introduce Trainable Weight Averaging (TWA), a novel optimization method that operates within a reduced subspace spanned by candidate weights and learns optimal weighting coefficients through optimization. TWA offers greater flexibility and can be applied to different training scenarios. For large-scale applications, we develop a distributed training framework that combines parallel computation with low-bit compression for the projection matrix, effectively managing memory and computational demands. TWA can be implemented using either training data (TWA-t) or validation data (TWA-v), with the latter providing more effective averaging. Extensive experiments showcase TWA's advantages: (i) it consistently outperforms SWA in generalization performance and flexibility, (ii) when applied during early training, it reduces training time by over 40\% on CIFAR datasets and 30\% on ImageNet while maintaining comparable performance, and (iii) during fine-tuning, it significantly enhances generalization by weighted averaging of model checkpoints. In summary, we present an efficient and effective framework for trainable weight averaging.

Better Fair than Sorry: Adversarial Missing Data Imputation for Fair GNNs,"arXiv:2311.01591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many relevant tasks where decisions might disproportionately impact specific communities. However, existing work on fair GNNs often assumes that either protected attributes are fully observed or that the missing protected attribute imputation is fair. In practice, biases in the imputation will propagate to the model outcomes, leading them to overestimate the fairness of their predictions. We address this challenge by proposing Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS), a fair missing data imputation model for protected attributes. The key design principle behind BFtS is that imputations should approximate the worst-case scenario for fairness -- i.e. when optimizing fairness is the hardest. We implement this idea using a 3-player adversarial scheme where two adversaries collaborate against a GNN-based classifier, and the classifier minimizes the maximum bias. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that BFtS often achieves a better fairness x accuracy trade-off than existing alternatives.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01591,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Neural Lattice Reduction: A Self-Supervised Geometric Deep Learning Approach,"arXiv:2311.08170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice reduction is a combinatorial optimization problem aimed at finding the most orthogonal basis in a given lattice. The Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\'asz (LLL) algorithm is the best algorithm in the literature for solving this problem. In light of recent research on algorithm discovery, in this work, we would like to answer this question: is it possible to parametrize the algorithm space for lattice reduction problem with neural networks and find an algorithm without supervised data? Our strategy is to use equivariant and invariant parametrizations and train in a self-supervised way. We design a deep neural model outputting factorized unimodular matrices and train it in a self-supervised manner by penalizing non-orthogonal lattice bases. We incorporate the symmetries of lattice reduction into the model by making it invariant to isometries and scaling of the ambient space and equivariant with respect to the hyperocrahedral group permuting and flipping the lattice basis elements. We show that this approach yields an algorithm with comparable complexity and performance to the LLL algorithm on a set of benchmarks. Additionally, motivated by certain applications for wireless communication, we extend our method to a convolutional architecture which performs joint reduction of spatially-correlated lattices arranged in a grid, thereby amortizing its cost over multiple lattices.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08170,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Partially Frozen Random Networks Contain Compact Strong Lottery Tickets,"arXiv:2402.14029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomly initialized dense networks contain subnetworks that achieve high accuracy without weight learning--strong lottery tickets (SLTs). Recently, Gadhikar et al. (2023) demonstrated that SLTs could also be found within a randomly pruned source network. This phenomenon can be exploited to further compress the small memory size required by SLTs. However, their method is limited to SLTs that are even sparser than the source, leading to worse accuracy due to unintentionally high sparsity. This paper proposes a method for reducing the SLT memory size without restricting the sparsity of the SLTs that can be found. A random subset of the initial weights is frozen by either permanently pruning them or locking them as a fixed part of the SLT, resulting in a smaller model size. Experimental results show that Edge-Popup (Ramanujan et al., 2020; Sreenivasan et al., 2022) finds SLTs with better accuracy-to-model size trade-off within frozen networks than within dense or randomly pruned source networks. In particular, freezing $70\%$ of a ResNet on ImageNet provides $3.3 \times$ compression compared to the SLT found within a dense counterpart, raises accuracy by up to $14.12$ points compared to the SLT found within a randomly pruned counterpart, and offers a better accuracy-model size trade-off than both.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14029,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Leveraging Interpolation Models and Error Bounds for Verifiable Scientific Machine Learning,"arXiv:2404.03586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective verification and validation techniques for modern scientific machine learning workflows are challenging to devise. Statistical methods are abundant and easily deployed, but often rely on speculative assumptions about the data and methods involved. Error bounds for classical interpolation techniques can provide mathematically rigorous estimates of accuracy, but often are difficult or impractical to determine computationally. In this work, we present a best-of-both-worlds approach to verifiable scientific machine learning by demonstrating that (1) multiple standard interpolation techniques have informative error bounds that can be computed or estimated efficiently; (2) comparative performance among distinct interpolants can aid in validation goals; (3) deploying interpolation methods on latent spaces generated by deep learning techniques enables some interpretability for black-box models. We present a detailed case study of our approach for predicting lift-drag ratios from airfoil images.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of completing knowledge intensive tasks by recalling information from a static pretraining corpus. Here we are concerned with LLMs in the context of evolving data requirements. For instance: batches of new data that are introduced periodically; subsets of data with user-based access controls; or requirements on dynamic removal of documents with guarantees that associated knowledge cannot be recalled. We wish to satisfy these requirements while at the same time ensuring a model does not forget old information when new data becomes available. To address these issues, we introduce AdapterSwap, a training and inference scheme that organizes knowledge from a data collection into a set of low-rank adapters, which are dynamically composed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate AdapterSwap's ability to support efficient continual learning, while also enabling organizations to have fine-grained control over data access and deletion.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08417,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
On the use of adversarial validation for quantifying dissimilarity in geospatial machine learning prediction,"arXiv:2404.12575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent geospatial machine learning studies have shown that the results of model evaluation via cross-validation (CV) are strongly affected by the dissimilarity between the sample data and the prediction locations. In this paper, we propose a method to quantify such a dissimilarity in the interval 0 to 100% and from the perspective of the data feature space. The proposed method is based on adversarial validation, which is an approach that can check whether sample data and prediction locations can be separated with a binary classifier. The proposed method is called dissimilarity quantification by adversarial validation (DAV). To study the effectiveness and general?ity of DAV, we tested it on a series of experiments based on both synthetic and real datasets and with gradually increasing dissimilarities. Results show that DAV effectively quantified dissimilarity across the entire range of values. Next to this, we studied how dissimilarity affects CV methods' evaluations by comparing the results of random CV method (RDM-CV) and of two geospatial CV methods, namely, block and spatial+ CV (BLK-CV and SP-CV). Our results showed the evaluations follow similar patterns in all datasets and predictions: when dissimilarity is low (usually lower than 30%), RDM-CV provides the most accurate evaluation results. As dissimilarity increases, geospatial CV methods, especially SP-CV, become more and more accurate and even outperform RDM-CV. When dissimilarity is high (>=90%), no CV method provides accurate evaluations. These results show the importance of considering feature space dissimilarity when working with geospatial machine learning predictions and can help researchers and practitioners to select more suitable CV methods for evaluating their predictions.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12575,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Docking: Are We There Yet?,"arXiv:2405.14108v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of the latest docking and structure prediction methods within the broadly applicable context of (1) using predicted (apo) protein structures for docking (e.g., for applicability to new proteins); (2) binding multiple (cofactor) ligands concurrently to a given target protein (e.g., for enzyme design); and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets (e.g., for generalization to unknown pockets). To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for broadly applicable protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure prediction using both primary ligand and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that (1) DL co-folding methods generally outperform comparable conventional and DL docking baselines, yet popular methods such as AlphaFold 3 are still challenged by prediction targets with novel protein sequences; (2) certain DL co-folding methods are highly sensitive to their input multiple sequence alignments, while others are not; and (3) DL methods struggle to strike a balance between structural accuracy and chemical specificity when predicting novel or multi-ligand protein targets.

Cascade of phase transitions in the training of Energy-based models,"arXiv:2405.14689v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14689,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Resource-constrained Fairness,"arXiv:2406.01290v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Access to resources strongly constrains the decisions we make. While we might wish to offer every student a scholarship, or schedule every patient for follow-up meetings with a specialist, limited resources mean that this is not possible. When deploying machine learning systems, these resource constraints are simply enforced by varying the threshold of a classifier. However, these finite resource limitations are disregarded by most existing tools for fair machine learning, which do not allow the specification of resource limitations and do not remain fair when varying thresholds. This makes them ill-suited for real-world deployment. Our research introduces the concept of ""resource-constrained fairness"" and quantifies the cost of fairness within this framework. We demonstrate that the level of available resources significantly influences this cost, a factor overlooked in previous evaluations.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01290,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Invariant Correlation of Representation with Label: Enhancing Domain Generalization in Noisy Environments,"arXiv:2407.01749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) approach aims to address the challenge of domain generalization by training a feature representation that remains invariant across multiple environments. However, in noisy environments, IRM-related techniques such as IRMv1 and VREx may be unable to achieve the optimal IRM solution, primarily due to erroneous optimization directions. To address this issue, we introduce ICorr (an abbreviation for Invariant Correlation), a novel approach designed to surmount the above challenge in noisy settings. Additionally, we dig into a case study to analyze why previous methods may lose ground while ICorr can succeed. Through a theoretical lens, particularly from a causality perspective, we illustrate that the invariant correlation of representation with label is a necessary condition for the optimal invariant predictor in noisy environments, whereas the optimization motivations for other methods may not be. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ICorr by comparing it with other domain generalization methods on various noisy datasets.

Learning to Steer Markovian Agents under Model Uncertainty,"arXiv:2407.10207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing incentives for an adapting population is a ubiquitous problem in a wide array of economic applications and beyond. In this work, we study how to design additional rewards to steer multi-agent systems towards desired policies \emph{without} prior knowledge of the agents' underlying learning dynamics. Motivated by the limitation of existing works, we consider a new and general category of learning dynamics called \emph{Markovian agents}. We introduce a model-based non-episodic Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation for our steering problem. Importantly, we focus on learning a \emph{history-dependent} steering strategy to handle the inherent model uncertainty about the agents' learning dynamics. We introduce a novel objective function to encode the desiderata of achieving a good steering outcome with reasonable cost. Theoretically, we identify conditions for the existence of steering strategies to guide agents to the desired policies. Complementing our theoretical contributions, we provide empirical algorithms to approximately solve our objective, which effectively tackles the challenge in learning history-dependent strategies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical evaluations.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10207,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
LRQ: Optimizing Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models by Learning Low-Rank Weight-Scaling Matrices,"arXiv:2407.11534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the commercialization of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization has emerged to compress and accelerate LLMs, achieving high throughput while reducing inference costs. However, existing post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques for quantizing weights and activations of LLMs still suffer from non-negligible accuracy drops, especially on massive multitask language understanding. To address this issue, we propose Low-Rank Quantization (LRQ) - a simple yet effective post-training weight quantization method for LLMs that reconstructs the outputs of an intermediate Transformer block by leveraging low-rank weight-scaling matrices, replacing the conventional full weight-scaling matrices that entail as many learnable scales as their associated weights. Thanks to parameter sharing via low-rank structure, LRQ only needs to learn significantly fewer parameters while enabling the individual scaling of weights, thus boosting the generalization capability of quantized LLMs. We show the superiority of LRQ over prior LLM PTQ works under (i) 8-bit weight and per-tensor activation quantization, (ii) 4-bit weight and 8-bit per-token activation quantization, and (iii) low-bit weight-only quantization schemes.

Certifiably Robust Policies for Uncertain Parametric Environments,"arXiv:2408.03093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach for producing policies that are provably robust across unknown stochastic environments. Existing approaches can learn models of a single environment as an interval Markov decision processes (IMDP) and produce a robust policy with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on its performance. However these are unable to reason about the impact of environmental parameters underlying the uncertainty. We propose a framework based on parametric Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unknown distributions over parameters. We learn and analyse IMDPs for a set of unknown sample environments induced by parameters. The key challenge is then to produce meaningful performance guarantees that combine the two layers of uncertainty: (1) multiple environments induced by parameters with an unknown distribution; (2) unknown induced environments which are approximated by IMDPs. We present a novel approach based on scenario optimisation that yields a single PAC guarantee quantifying the risk level for which a specified performance level can be assured in unseen environments, plus a means to trade-off risk and performance. We implement and evaluate our framework using multiple robust policy generation methods on a range of benchmarks.

Near-Optimal Policy Identification in Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes via Epigraph Form,"arXiv:2408.16286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing a safe policy for uncertain environments is crucial in real-world control systems. However, this challenge remains inadequately addressed within the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. This paper presents the first algorithm guaranteed to identify a near-optimal policy in a robust constrained MDP (RCMDP), where an optimal policy minimizes cumulative cost while satisfying constraints in the worst-case scenario across a set of environments. We first prove that the conventional policy gradient approach to the Lagrangian max-min formulation can become trapped in suboptimal solutions. This occurs when its inner minimization encounters a sum of conflicting gradients from the objective and constraint functions. To address this, we leverage the epigraph form of the RCMDP problem, which resolves the conflict by selecting a single gradient from either the objective or the constraints. Building on the epigraph form, we propose a bisection search algorithm with a policy gradient subroutine and prove that it identifies an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an RCMDP with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ robust policy evaluations.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16286,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Scaling FP8 training to trillion-token LLMs,"arXiv:2409.12517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We train, for the first time, large language models using FP8 precision on datasets up to 2 trillion tokens -- a 20-fold increase over previous limits. Through these extended training runs, we uncover critical instabilities in FP8 training that were not observable in earlier works with shorter durations. We trace these instabilities to outlier amplification by the SwiGLU activation function. Interestingly, we show, both analytically and empirically, that this amplification happens only over prolonged training periods, and link it to a SwiGLU weight alignment process. To address this newly identified issue, we introduce Smooth-SwiGLU, a novel modification that ensures stable FP8 training without altering function behavior. We also demonstrate, for the first time, FP8 quantization of both Adam optimizer moments. Combining these innovations, we successfully train a 7B parameter model using FP8 precision on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators, achieving on-par results with the BF16 baseline while delivering up to a $\sim 34 \%$ throughput improvement.

However most works don't target the largest component of allocated memory during training: the model's compute graph, which is stored for the backward pass. By storing low-rank, compressed activations to be used in the backward pass we greatly reduce the required memory, unlike previous methods which only reduce optimizer overheads or the number of trained parameters. Our compression uses random projection matrices, thus avoiding additional memory overheads. Comparisons with previous techniques for either pretraining or fine-tuning show that CompAct substantially improves existing compute-performance tradeoffs.

MARS: Unleashing the Power of Variance Reduction for Training Large Models,"arXiv:2411.10438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks--and more recently, large models demands efficient and scalable optimizers. Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw a connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by a large margin.

Explaining the Unexplained: Revealing Hidden Correlations for Better Interpretability,"arXiv:2412.01365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in processing and managing unstructured data. However, its ""black box"" nature imposes significant limitations, particularly in sensitive application domains. While existing interpretable machine learning methods address some of these issues, they often fail to adequately consider feature correlations and provide insufficient evaluation of model decision paths. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Real Explainer (RealExp), an interpretability computation method that decouples the Shapley Value into individual feature importance and feature correlation importance. By incorporating feature similarity computations, RealExp enhances interpretability by precisely quantifying both individual feature contributions and their interactions, leading to more reliable and nuanced explanations. Additionally, this paper proposes a novel interpretability evaluation criterion focused on elucidating the decision paths of deep learning models, going beyond traditional accuracy-based metrics. Experimental validations on two unstructured data tasks -- image classification and text sentiment analysis -- demonstrate that RealExp significantly outperforms existing methods in interpretability. Case studies further illustrate its practical value: in image classification, RealExp aids in selecting suitable pre-trained models for specific tasks from an interpretability perspective; in text classification, it enables the optimization of models and approximates the performance of a fine-tuned GPT-Ada model using traditional bag-of-words approaches.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01365,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: Accurate origin-destination (OD) passenger flow prediction is crucial for enhancing metro system efficiency, optimizing scheduling, and improving passenger experiences. However, current models often fail to effectively capture the asynchronous departure characteristics of OD flows and underutilize the inflow and outflow data, which limits their prediction accuracy. To address these issues, we propose CSP-AIT-Net, a novel spatiotemporal graph attention framework designed to enhance OD flow prediction by incorporating asynchronous inflow tracking and advanced station semantics representation. Our framework restructures the OD flow prediction paradigm by first predicting outflows and then decomposing OD flows using a spatiotemporal graph attention mechanism. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a masking mechanism and propose asynchronous passenger flow graphs that integrate inflow and OD flow with conservation constraints. Furthermore, we employ contrastive learning to extract high-dimensional land use semantics of metro stations, enriching the contextual understanding of passenger mobility patterns. Validation of the Shanghai metro system demonstrates improvement in short-term OD flow prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Despite excellent real-world predictive performance of modern machine learning (ML) methods, many scientists hesitate to discard traditional physical-conceptual (PC) approaches due to their relative interpretability, which contributes to credibility during decision-making. In this context, a currently underexplored aspect of ML is how to develop minimally-optimal representations that can facilitate better insight regarding system functioning. Regardless of how this is achieved, parsimonious representations seem to better support the advancement of scientific understanding. Our own view is that ML-based modeling should be based in use of computational units that are fundamentally interpretable by design.
  This paper continues our exploration of how ML can be exploited in the service of scientific investigation. We use the Mass-Conserving-Perceptron (MCP) as the fundamental computational unit in a generic network architecture to explore important issues related to the use of observational data for constructing models of dynamical systems. We show, in the context of lumped catchment modeling, that physical interpretability and predictive performance can both be achieved using a relatively parsimonious distributed-state multiple-flow-path network with context-dependent gating and information sharing across the nodes, suggesting that MCP-based modeling can play a significant role in application of ML to geoscientific investigation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04845,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Phase-aware Training Schedule Simplifies Learning in Flow-Based Generative Models,"arXiv:2412.07972v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the training of a two-layer autoencoder used to parameterize a flow-based generative model for sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian mixture. Previous work shows that the phase where the relative probability between the modes is learned disappears as the dimension goes to infinity without an appropriate time schedule. We introduce a time dilation that solves this problem. This enables us to characterize the learned velocity field, finding a first phase where the probability of each mode is learned and a second phase where the variance of each mode is learned. We find that the autoencoder representing the velocity field learns to simplify by estimating only the parameters relevant to each phase. Turning to real data, we propose a method that, for a given feature, finds intervals of time where training improves accuracy the most on that feature. Since practitioners take a uniform distribution over training times, our method enables more efficient training. We provide preliminary experiments validating this approach.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07972,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Federated Domain Generalization with Label Smoothing and Balanced Decentralized Training,"arXiv:2412.11408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Federated Domain Generalization with Label Smoothing and Balanced Decentralized Training (FedSB), to address the challenges of data heterogeneity within a federated learning framework. FedSB utilizes label smoothing at the client level to prevent overfitting to domain-specific features, thereby enhancing generalization capabilities across diverse domains when aggregating local models into a global model. Additionally, FedSB incorporates a decentralized budgeting mechanism which balances training among clients, which is shown to improve the performance of the aggregated global model. Extensive experiments on four commonly used multi-domain datasets, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and TerraInc, demonstrate that FedSB outperforms competing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on three out of four datasets, indicating the effectiveness of FedSB in addressing data heterogeneity.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11408,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
AdaPRL: Adaptive Pairwise Regression Learning with Uncertainty Estimation for Universal Regression Tasks,"arXiv:2501.05809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current deep regression models usually learn in a point-wise way that treats each sample as an independent input, neglecting the relative ordering among different data. Consequently, the regression model could neglect the data's interrelationships, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance. Moreover, the existence of aleatoric uncertainty in the training data may drive the model to capture non-generalizable patterns, contributing to increased overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a novel adaptive pairwise learning framework for regression tasks (AdaPRL) which leverages the relative differences between data points and integrates with deep probabilistic models to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Additionally, we adapt AdaPRL for applications in multi-task learning and multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments with several real-world regression datasets including recommendation systems, age prediction, time series forecasting, natural language understanding, finance, and industry datasets show that AdaPRL is compatible with different backbone networks in various tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the vast majority of tasks without extra inference cost, highlighting its notable potential including enhancing prediction accuracy and ranking ability, increasing generalization capability, improving robustness to noisy data, improving resilience to reduced data, and enhancing interpretability. Experiments also show that AdaPRL can be seamlessly incorporated into recently proposed regression frameworks to gain performance improvement.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05809,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Inference-Time-Compute: More Faithful?,"arXiv:2501.08156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models trained specifically to generate long Chains of Thought (CoTs) have recently achieved impressive results. We refer to these models as Inference-Time-Compute (ITC) models. Are the CoTs of ITC models more faithful compared to traditional non-ITC models? We evaluate three ITC models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test if models articulate a cue in their prompt that influences their answers to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue ""A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D"" is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 ITC model articulates the cue 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-ITC DeepSeek. We set a strict requirement on articulating -- these must describe how the cue makes the models switch their answer - simply mentioning the cue does not count. We evaluate 7 types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and anchoring on past responses. ITC models articulate cues that influence them much more reliably than all the 7 non-ITC models tested, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o, which often articulate close to 0% of the time. Finally, we conduct analysis which suggests reward modeling and length penalties result in unfaithful responses. However, our study has important limitations. We cannot evaluate OpenAI's SOTA o3 model. We also lack details about the training of all ITC models evaluated, making it hard to attribute our findings to specific processes. Faithfulness of CoT is an important property for AI Safety. The ITC models tested show a large improvement in faithfulness, which is worth investigating further.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08156,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Beyond Any-Shot Adaptation: Predicting Optimization Outcome for Robustness Gains without Extra Pay,"arXiv:2501.11039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The foundation model enables fast problem-solving without learning from scratch, and such a desirable adaptation property benefits from its adopted cross-task generalization paradigms, e.g., pretraining, meta-training, and finetuning. Recent advances in these paradigms show the crucial role of challenging tasks' prioritized sampling in enhancing adaptation robustness and even improving sampling efficiency. However, scoring task difficulties exhausts massive task queries and requires intensive evaluation and computations, e.g., policy evaluations in Markov decision processes (MDPs) or inference with large backbone models. This work underscores the criticality of both adaptation robustness and learning efficiency, especially in scenarios where tasks are risky to collect or costly to evaluate. To this end, we present Model Predictive Task Sampling (MPTS) to establish connections between the task space and adaptation risk landscape for robust active task sampling. Technically, MPTS characterizes the task episodic information with a generative model and predicts optimization outcome, i.e., task-specific adaptation risk values, from posterior inference. The resulting risk learner amortizes expensive annotation, evaluation, or computation operations in task robust adaptation. Extensive experimental results show that MPTS can be seamlessly integrated into zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot learning paradigms, increases adaptation robustness, and retains learning efficiency without affording extra cost.

Transfer Learning of Surrogate Models via Domain Affine Transformation Across Synthetic and Real-World Benchmarks,"arXiv:2501.14012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate models are frequently employed as efficient substitutes for the costly execution of real-world processes. However, constructing a high-quality surrogate model often demands extensive data acquisition. A solution to this issue is to transfer pre-trained surrogate models for new tasks, provided that certain invariances exist between tasks. This study focuses on transferring non-differentiable surrogate models (e.g., random forest) from a source function to a target function, where we assume their domains are related by an unknown affine transformation, using only a limited amount of transfer data points evaluated on the target. Previous research attempts to tackle this challenge for differentiable models, e.g., Gaussian process regression, which minimizes the empirical loss on the transfer data by tuning the affine transformations. In this paper, we extend the previous work to the random forest model and assess its effectiveness on a widely-used artificial problem set - Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) testbed, and on four real-world transfer learning problems. The results highlight the significant practical advantages of the proposed method, particularly in reducing both the data requirements and computational costs of training surrogate models for complex real-world scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14012,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Detecting Backdoor Samples in Contrastive Language Image Pretraining,"arXiv:2502.01385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has been found to be vulnerable to poisoning backdoor attacks where the adversary can achieve an almost perfect attack success rate on CLIP models by poisoning only 0.01\% of the training dataset. This raises security concerns on the current practice of pretraining large-scale models on unscrutinized web data using CLIP. In this work, we analyze the representations of backdoor-poisoned samples learned by CLIP models and find that they exhibit unique characteristics in their local subspace, i.e., their local neighborhoods are far more sparse than that of clean samples. Based on this finding, we conduct a systematic study on detecting CLIP backdoor attacks and show that these attacks can be easily and efficiently detected by traditional density ratio-based local outlier detectors, whereas existing backdoor sample detection methods fail. Our experiments also reveal that an unintentional backdoor already exists in the original CC3M dataset and has been trained into a popular open-source model released by OpenCLIP. Based on our detector, one can clean up a million-scale web dataset (e.g., CC3M) efficiently within 15 minutes using 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs.

Explaining Context Length Scaling and Bounds for Language Models,"arXiv:2502.01481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long Context Language Models have drawn great attention in the past few years. There has been work discussing the impact of long context on Language Model performance: some find that long irrelevant context could harm performance, while some experimentally summarize loss reduction by relevant long context as Scaling Laws. This calls for a more thorough understanding on how long context impact Language Modeling. In this work, we (1) propose a clean and effective theoretical framework on explaining the impact of context length to Language Modeling, from an Intrinsic Space perspective; and (2) conduct experiments on natural language and synthetic data, validating our proposed theoretical assumptions and deductions. Our theoretical framework can provide practical insights such as establishing that training dataset size dictates an optimal context length and bounds context length scaling for certain case.

Enhancing Pre-Trained Decision Transformers with Prompt-Tuning Bandits,"arXiv:2502.04979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harnessing large offline datasets is vital for training foundation models that can generalize across diverse tasks. Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful framework for these scenarios, enabling the derivation of optimal policies even from suboptimal data. The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) is an offline RL multi-task model that distinguishes tasks through stochastic trajectory prompts, which are task-specific tokens maintained in context during rollouts. However, PDT samples these tokens uniformly at random from per-task demonstration datasets, failing to account for differences in token informativeness and potentially leading to performance degradation. To address this limitation, we introduce a scalable bandit-based prompt-tuning method that dynamically learns to construct high-performance trajectory prompts. Our approach significantly enhances downstream task performance without modifying the pre-trained Transformer backbone. Empirical results on benchmark tasks and a newly designed multi-task environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, creating a seamless bridge between general multi-task offline pre-training and task-specific online adaptation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04979,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14295,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Quantifying the Cross-sectoral Intersecting Discrepancies within Multiple Groups Using Latent Class Analysis Towards Fairness,"arXiv:2407.03133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in fair AI development is evident. The ''Leave No One Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including both EVENS and Census 2021 (England & Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies both among minority ethnic groups and between minority ethnic groups and non-minority ethnic groups, emphasising the need for targeted interventions in policy-making processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can provide valuable insights into ensuring fairness in machine learning systems.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03133,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Machine learning surrogates for efficient hydrologic modeling: Insights from stochastic simulations of managed aquifer recharge,"arXiv:2407.20902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process-based hydrologic models are invaluable tools for understanding the terrestrial water cycle and addressing modern water resources problems. However, many hydrologic models are computationally expensive and, depending on the resolution and scale, simulations can take on the order of hours to days to complete. While techniques such as uncertainty quantification and optimization have become valuable tools for supporting management decisions, these analyses typically require hundreds of model simulations, which are too computationally expensive to perform with a process-based hydrologic model. To address this gap, we assess a hybrid modeling workflow in which a process-based model is used to generate an initial set of simulations and a machine learning (ML) surrogate model is then trained to perform the remaining simulations required for downstream analysis. As a case study, we apply this workflow to simulations of variably saturated groundwater flow at a prospective managed aquifer recharge site. We compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of several ML architectures, including deep convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, vision transformers, and networks with Fourier transforms. Our results demonstrate that ML surrogate models can achieve under 10% mean absolute percentage error and yield order-of-magnitude runtime savings over process-based models. Building on these findings, we examine the impacts of key modeling choices on surrogate model accuracy and efficiency. Results show that a normalized loss function improves training stability, while min-max data normalization can significantly reduce error up to a factor of 10 when compared to other treatments such as Z-score and no normalization. Downsampling input features using an autoencoder also decreases memory requirements by training with tensors 4% their original size.

Audio-visual cross-modality knowledge transfer for machine learning-based in-situ monitoring in laser additive manufacturing,"arXiv:2408.05307v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various machine learning (ML)-based in-situ monitoring systems have been developed to detect anomalies and defects in laser additive manufacturing (LAM) processes. While multimodal fusion, which integrates data from visual, audio, and other modalities, can improve monitoring performance, it also increases hardware, computational, and operational costs. This paper introduces a cross-modality knowledge transfer (CMKT) methodology for LAM in-situ monitoring, which transfers knowledge from a source modality to a target modality. CMKT enhances the representativeness of the features extracted from the target modality, allowing the removal of source modality sensors during prediction. This paper proposes three CMKT methods: semantic alignment, fully supervised mapping, and semi-supervised mapping. The semantic alignment method establishes a shared encoded space between modalities to facilitate knowledge transfer. It employs a semantic alignment loss to align the distributions of identical groups (e.g., visual and audio defective groups) and a separation loss to distinguish different groups (e.g., visual defective and audio defect-free groups). The two mapping methods transfer knowledge by deriving features from one modality to another using fully supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches. In a case study for LAM in-situ defect detection, the proposed CMKT methods were compared with multimodal audio-visual fusion. The semantic alignment method achieved an accuracy of 98.6% while removing the audio modality during the prediction phase, which is comparable to the 98.2% accuracy obtained through multimodal fusion. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we discovered that semantic alignment CMKT can extract more representative features while reducing noise by leveraging the inherent correlations between modalities.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05307,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: Delineating and classifying individual cells in microscopy tissue images is inherently challenging yet remains essential for advancements in medical and neuroscientific research. In this work, we propose a new deep learning framework, CISCA, for automatic cell instance segmentation and classification in histological slices. At the core of CISCA is a network architecture featuring a lightweight U-Net with three heads in the decoder. The first head classifies pixels into boundaries between neighboring cells, cell bodies, and background, while the second head regresses four distance maps along four directions. The outputs from the first and second heads are integrated through a tailored post-processing step, which ultimately produces the segmentation of individual cells. The third head enables the simultaneous classification of cells into relevant classes, if required. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using four datasets, including CoNIC, PanNuke, and MoNuSeg, which are publicly available H&Estained datasets that cover diverse tissue types and magnifications. In addition, we introduce CytoDArk0, the first annotated dataset of Nissl-stained histological images of the mammalian brain, containing nearly 40k annotated neurons and glia cells, aimed at facilitating advancements in digital neuropathology and brain cytoarchitecture studies. We evaluate CISCA against other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its versatility, robustness, and accuracy in segmenting and classifying cells across diverse tissue types, magnifications, and staining techniques.

Abstract: Urban air pollution hotspots pose significant health risks, yet their detection and analysis remain limited by the sparsity of public sensor networks. This paper addresses this challenge by combining predictive modeling and mechanistic approaches to comprehensively monitor pollution hotspots. We enhanced New Delhi's existing sensor network with 28 low-cost sensors, collecting PM2.5 data over 30 months from May 1, 2018, to Nov 1, 2020. Applying established definitions of hotspots to this data, we found the existence of additional 189 hidden hotspots apart from confirming 660 hotspots detected by the public network. Using predictive techniques like Space-Time Kriging, we identified hidden hotspots with 95% precision and 88% recall with 50% sensor failure rate, and with 98% precision and 95% recall with 50% missing sensors. The projected results of our predictive models were further compiled into policy recommendations for public authorities. Additionally, we developed a Gaussian Plume Dispersion Model to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of hotspot formation, incorporating an emissions inventory derived from local sources. Our mechanistic model is able to explain 65% of observed transient hotspots. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating data-driven predictive models with physics-based mechanistic models for scalable and robust air pollution management in resource-constrained settings.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04309,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: We investigate the in-context learning capabilities of transformers for the $d$-dimensional mixture of linear regression model, providing theoretical insights into their existence, generalization bounds, and training dynamics. Specifically, we prove that there exists a transformer capable of achieving a prediction error of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d/n})$ with high probability, where $n$ represents the training prompt size in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, we derive in-context excess risk bounds of order $\mathcal{O}(L/\sqrt{B})$ for the case of two mixtures, where $B$ denotes the number of training prompts, and $L$ represents the number of attention layers. The dependence of $L$ on the SNR is explicitly characterized, differing between low and high SNR settings. We further analyze the training dynamics of transformers with single linear self-attention layers, demonstrating that, with appropriately initialized parameters, gradient flow optimization over the population mean square loss converges to a global optimum.

These concepts are passed on to an open-vocabulary segmentation model for precise segmentation maps.

FlexSP: Accelerating Large Language Model Training via Flexible Sequence Parallelism,"arXiv:2412.01523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending the context length (i.e., the maximum supported sequence length) of LLMs is of paramount significance. To facilitate long context training of LLMs, sequence parallelism has emerged as an essential technique, which scatters each input sequence across multiple devices and necessitates communication to process the sequence. In essence, existing sequence parallelism methods assume homogeneous sequence lengths (i.e., all input sequences are equal in length) and therefore leverages a single, static scattering strategy for all input sequences. However, in reality, the sequence lengths in LLM training corpora exhibit substantial variability, often following a long-tail distribution, which leads to workload heterogeneity. In this paper, we show that employing a single, static strategy results in inefficiency and resource under-utilization, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches to handle the heterogeneous workloads across sequences. To address this, we propose a heterogeneity-adaptive sequence parallelism method. For each training step, our approach captures the variability in sequence lengths and assigns the optimal combination of scattering strategies based on workload characteristics. We model this problem as a linear programming optimization and design an efficient and effective solver to find the optimal solution. Furthermore, we implement our method in a high-performance system that supports adaptive parallelization in distributed LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art training frameworks by up to 1.98x.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01523,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: Robot manipulation policies often fail for unknown reasons, posing significant challenges for real-world deployment. Researchers and engineers typically address these failures using heuristic approaches, which are not only labor-intensive and costly but also prone to overlooking critical failure modes (FMs).

Considering the vast space of potential FMs in a pre-trained manipulation policy, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) to explore and uncover these FMs using a specially trained vision-language embedding that encodes a notion of failures. This approach enables users to probabilistically quantify and rank failures in previously unseen environmental conditions. Through extensive experiments across various manipulation tasks and algorithms, we demonstrate RoboMD's effectiveness in diagnosing unknown failures in unstructured environments, providing a systematic pathway to improve the robustness of manipulation policies.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02818,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: We consider the inference for the ranking of large language models (LLMs). Alignment arises as a significant challenge to mitigate hallucinations in the use of LLMs. Ranking LLMs has proven to be an effective tool to improve alignment based on the best-of-$N$ policy. In this paper, we propose a new inferential framework for hypothesis testing among the ranking for language models. Our framework is based on a nonparametric contextual ranking framework designed to assess large language models' domain-specific expertise, leveraging nonparametric scoring methods to account for their sensitivity to the prompts. To characterize the combinatorial complexity of the ranking, we introduce a novel concept of confidence diagram, which leverages a Hasse diagram to represent the entire confidence set of rankings by a single directed graph. We show the validity of the proposed confidence diagram by advancing the Gaussian multiplier bootstrap theory to accommodate the supremum of independent empirical processes that are not necessarily identically distributed. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our approach offers valuable insight into the evaluation for the performance of different LLMs across various medical domains.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05506,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"

Abstract: We introduce a new task called Defeasible Visual Entailment (DVE), where the goal is to allow the modification of the entailment relationship between an image premise and a text hypothesis based on an additional update. While this concept is well-established in Natural Language Inference, it remains unexplored in visual entailment. At a high level, DVE enables models to refine their initial interpretations, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in various applications such as detecting misleading information in images, enhancing visual question answering, and refining decision-making processes in autonomous systems. Existing metrics do not adequately capture the change in the entailment relationship brought by updates. To address this, we propose a novel inference-aware evaluator designed to capture changes in entailment strength induced by updates, using pairwise contrastive learning and categorical information learning.

Perception-Guided EEG Analysis: A Deep Learning Approach Inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) Theory,"arXiv:2501.10428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: This study explores a novel deep learning approach for EEG analysis and perceptual state guidance, inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) theory. The goal is to improve perceptual state identification accuracy and advance personalized psychological therapy. Methods: Portable EEG devices and music rhythm signals were used for data collection. LOD theory was applied to dynamically adjust EEG signal processing, extracting core perceptual features. A Unity-based software system integrated EEG data with audio materials. The deep learning model combined a CNN for feature extraction and classification, and a DQN for reinforcement learning to optimize rhythm adjustments. Results: The CNN achieved 94.05% accuracy in perceptual state classification. The DQN guided subjects to target states with a 92.45% success rate, averaging 13.2 rhythm cycles. However, only 50% of users reported psychological alignment with the target state, indicating room for improvement. Discussion: The results validate the potential of LOD-based EEG biofeedback. Limitations include dataset source, label subjectivity, and reward function optimization. Future work will expand to diverse subjects, incorporate varied musical elements, and refine reward functions for better generalization and personalization.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10428,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Jailbreaking LLMs' Safeguard with Universal Magic Words for Text Embedding Models,"arXiv:2501.18280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained significant attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful outputs, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18280,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Exploring Audio Editing Features as User-Centric Privacy Defenses Against Large Language Model(LLM) Based Emotion Inference Attacks,"arXiv:2501.18727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of speech-enabled technologies, including virtual assistants, video conferencing platforms, and wearable devices, has raised significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the inference of sensitive emotional information from audio data. Existing privacy-preserving methods often compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages familiar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation, to protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing popular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified these features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated their effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks from diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on three distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation effectively obfuscates emotional data. Additionally, we explore the design principles for lightweight, on-device implementation to ensure broad applicability across various devices and platforms.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18727,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Generating crossmodal gene expression from cancer histopathology improves multimodal AI predictions,"arXiv:2502.00568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging research has highlighted that artificial intelligence based multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomic features can improve cancer diagnosis (grading/subtyping) and prognosis (survival risk) prediction. However, such direct fusion for joint decision is impractical in real clinical settings, where histopathology is still the gold standard for diagnosis and transcriptomic tests are rarely requested, at least in the public healthcare system. With our novel diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model PathoGen, we show that genomic expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predicts cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed attention maps). PathoGen code is available for open use by the research community through GitHub at https://github.com/Samiran-Dey/PathoGen.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00568,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
Group-Adaptive Threshold Optimization for Robust AI-Generated Text Detection,"arXiv:2502.04528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to differentiate human-written text from AI-generated text. Several AI-text detectors have been developed in response, which typically utilize a fixed global threshold (e.g., {\theta} = 0.5) to classify machine-generated text. However, we find that one universal threshold can fail to account for subgroup-specific distributional variations. For example, when using a fixed threshold, detectors make more false positive errors on shorter human-written text than longer, and more positive classifications on neurotic writing styles than open among long text. These discrepancies can lead to misclassification that disproportionately affects certain groups. We address this critical limitation by introducing FairOPT, an algorithm for group-specific threshold optimization in AI-generated content classifiers. Our approach partitions data into subgroups based on attributes (e.g., text length and writing style) and learns decision thresholds for each group, which enables careful balancing of performance and fairness metrics within each subgroup. In experiments with four AI text classifiers on three datasets, FairOPT enhances overall F1 score and decreases balanced error rate (BER) discrepancy across subgroups. Our framework paves the way for more robust and fair classification criteria in AI-generated output detection.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04528,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
"STRIDE: Automating Reward Design, Deep Reinforcement Learning Training and Feedback Optimization in Humanoid Robotics Locomotion","arXiv:2502.04692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robotics presents significant challenges in artificial intelligence, requiring precise coordination and control of high-degree-of-freedom systems. Designing effective reward functions for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in this domain remains a critical bottleneck, demanding extensive manual effort, domain expertise, and iterative refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce STRIDE, a novel framework built on agentic engineering to automate reward design, DRL training, and feedback optimization for humanoid robot locomotion tasks. By combining the structured principles of agentic engineering with large language models (LLMs) for code-writing, zero-shot generation, and in-context optimization, STRIDE generates, evaluates, and iteratively refines reward functions without relying on task-specific prompts or templates. Across diverse environments featuring humanoid robot morphologies, STRIDE outperforms the state-of-the-art reward design framework EUREKA, achieving significant improvements in efficiency and task performance. Using STRIDE-generated rewards, simulated humanoid robots achieve sprint-level locomotion across complex terrains, highlighting its ability to advance DRL workflows and humanoid robotics research.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04692,"Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500"
