# This is a commented-out Conda environment configuration file (airflow-env.yml) for the LSU Datastore Dashboard.
# It defines dependencies for setting up an Apache Airflow environment, which could be used in the future to
# manage and schedule data workflows, such as the data-fetching script (fetch_lsu_course_data) or other ETL
# processes for the dashboard. Airflow can orchestrate tasks like web scraping, data processing, and database
# updates, providing a robust scheduling and monitoring system. This file could be used to:
# - Create a Conda environment for Airflow: `conda env create -f airflow-env.yml`
# - Schedule recurring data collection tasks (e.g., fetching LSU course data daily).
# - Integrate with the existing GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment of Airflow DAGs.
# - Manage dependencies for Airflow DAGs that interact with SQLite, pandas, and external APIs.
