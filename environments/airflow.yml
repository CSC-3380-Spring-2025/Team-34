# This is a commented-out Conda environment configuration file (airflow-env.yml) for the LSU Datastore Dashboard.
# It defines dependencies for setting up an Apache Airflow environment, which could be used in the future to
# orchestrate complex data workflows for the dashboard, such as integrating with external APIs for real-time data
# updates or automating data validation and reporting processes. Airflow can enhance the project by providing:
# - A centralized platform for managing data pipelines, such as syncing course data (fetched by fetch_lsu_course_data)
#   with external systems like a cloud database or analytics platform.
# - Automated retry and alerting mechanisms for failed API requests (e.g., in parse_course_page or fetch_jobs_data).
# - Integration with Streamlit for dynamic updates, where Airflow could trigger data refreshes and notify the app.
# To use this file, create a Conda environment with: `conda env create -f airflow-env.yml`.
