# This is a commented-out Conda environment configuration file (test-env.yml) for the LSU Datastore Dashboard.
# It defines dependencies for a comprehensive testing and development environment, aimed at improving code quality,
# testing coverage, and development workflows for the Team-34 project. While not currently used, this file could be
# leveraged in the future to:
# - Set up a robust testing environment with pytest, coverage, and hypothesis for unit, integration, and property-based
#   testing of scripts like fetch_lsu_course_data, database.py, and rendering scripts (data_page.py, home.py, etc.).
# - Enhance code quality with linting tools (pylint, flake8, black) and pre-commit hooks, integrating with the existing
#   GitHub Actions workflow (Dev Branch CI/CD Pipeline) for automated checks.
# - Support interactive development and debugging with ipython and jupyterlab, allowing for exploratory data analysis
#   (e.g., analyzing course data with pandas, numpy, scipy, sympy) and visualization prototyping (matplotlib, seaborn).
# - Improve testing performance with tqdm for progress tracking during large-scale tests (e.g., testing parse_course_page).
# To use this file, create a Conda environment with: `conda env create -f test-env.yml`, then run tests with `pytest`
# or start a JupyterLab session with `jupyter lab`.
