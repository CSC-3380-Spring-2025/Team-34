# This is a commented-out Conda environment configuration file (prod-env.yml) for the LSU Datastore Dashboard.
# It defines dependencies for a production-ready environment, expanding beyond the current development setup to
# support advanced features, scalability, and deployment scenarios for the Team-34 project. While not currently used,
# this file could be leveraged in the future to:
# - Deploy the dashboard as a production application, either via Streamlit or as a FastAPI/Flask-based API for broader
#   access (e.g., exposing course data via REST endpoints).
# - Enable cloud integration with AWS (using boto3) for storage (e.g., S3 for CSV/Parquet files) or hosting (e.g., EC2).
# - Support advanced data processing and machine learning (using scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, pyarrow) for features like
#   course recommendation or analytics.
# - Migrate the database from SQLite to PostgreSQL or MySQL (using psycopg2, pymysql) for better scalability.
# - Enhance visualization capabilities with matplotlib and seaborn alongside Plotly (already used in visualize_data.py).
# - Improve performance with tqdm for progress tracking during large data processing tasks.
# To use this file, create a Conda environment with: `conda env create -f prod-env.yml`, then deploy the app using
# gunicorn (e.g., `gunicorn -w 4 app:app` for a Flask app) or uvicorn (e.g., `uvicorn app:app` for a FastAPI app).
